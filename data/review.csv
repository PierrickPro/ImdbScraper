1,1, Perhaps accurate about human nature and the media...but too gross and easy to hate this episode.,3.0,"This first episode of ""Black Mirror"" is a lousy one because compared to later episodes it's very disappointing. It's also pretty revolting and I suggest you perhaps see this one AFTER you've seen a few of the better ones!The show begins by someone announcing on YouTube that he's kidnapped a member of the royal family. Their demand is that the Prime Minister have sex with a pig...live and unaltered on national television. Much of this episode is insightful when it comes to human nature and the media. That being said, surely there must have been a BETTER way to get the point than this...especially since it involves pork. You could do better and they DO get better."
1,1, Let's See If It Sticks!,5.0,"Other reviewers assure me that this series is worth a look. I agree with a previous commentator, that had this been the first episode I watched, it would be the last. It did pique my interest because all of us are voyeurs and are wondering how it will be pulled off. Well, no such luck. I thought that the writers would be able to come up with a satisfactory conclusion. So, it's performance art. So the guy who did it showed us our dark side. It's still disgusting and I'm not prudish about most things. The other thing is that no government agency would ever let such a thing proceed. I will watch the next one on the promise that something more palatable would come forth."
1,1," Sick, Tense and Realistic Story",8.0,"In London, in Christmas, the Prime Minister Michael Callow (Rory Kinnear) is awakened by his advisors Alex Cairns (Lindsay Duncan) and Julian Hereford (Donald Sumpter) that show a video of Princess Susannah of Beaumont (Lydia Wilson) to him. The princess is the pride and joy of the Royal Family and beloved by the people, and she tells that she was kidnapped. Further, the kidnapper demands that Michael have sex with a pig on live television; otherwise he would kill her. Michael's wife Jane Callow (Anna Wilson-Jones) supports her husband while his advisors try to hire a porn star to perform the act while the secret service tries unsuccessfully to track the kidnapper down. Meanwhile the media seeks for news at any cost. What will the prime minister do?""The National Anthem"" is the promising beginning of ""Black Mirror"", with a realistic and sick story of terrorism. The plot is tense and the attempt to find the responsible in short time is still impressive. The story shows the power of Internet and how unethical and destructive the press can be in certain situations seeking for a scoop. The conclusion is very ironic. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available on DVD and Blu-Ray"
1,1," Black comedy, but only just.",6.0,"I know the reviews for this one are generally hugely positive, but I find the first episode a bit of a stumbling block, When you think of subsequent episodes this one just lacks the true cutting edge. Sure it's a disturbing watch, and the performances are superb, fair play to Rory Kinnear, he is superb here, such an amiable actor, it adds to the repulsion and sorrow you feel for the character. The problem I have with this one, is the only picture I have in my mind is David Cameron holding that piglet, distressing all round. It's slick in delivery, it's definitely sick, just a story I'm not particularly struck on, a good watch though."
1,1," ""The Public, the Palace, and the Party insist on compliance.""",4.0,"I think we've pretty much hit the lowest common denominator here, haven't we folks? There are those reviews who claim that this show was meant to make us think, and that's probably true. I think it points out the cultural rot that's invaded our lives via easy to use technologies that make a connection with millions of people possible in an instant. I'm new to Netflix and 'Black Mirror', so I'm actually somewhat surprised that the terrorist act committed in the story hasn't been tried for real by now, since this episode aired back in 2011. But what the heck, with ISIS beheadings going viral and all manner of perverse images showing up on the Internet and spinoff technologies like Facebook and Twitter, it's probably just a matter of time. I can say one thing realistically, if this event were to happen for real, I would not be participating in the voyeuristic show, no matter how sensational. And if I were ever in the position of the Prime Minister, my reaction would be like the guy in the joke who encountered his friend, bitten on the butt by a rattlesnake. The alternative to sucking out the poison would be - 'You're gonna die'."
1,1, Incredibly bold and prescient,9.0,"With all the allegations (uncorroborated) around Piggate (just Google it), this series opener was incredibly prescient big time. Charlie Brooker is one talented guy, and his creation of Black Mirror really tapped into our social media/mobile phone/internet/Facebook obsession. This was before Pokemon Go by the way.This episode is disturbing in many ways, and you can sort of imagine pranksters pulling off such a stunt to humiliate those in power. Wow! Anyway, you are kept guessing until the end and you wonder will the British Prime Minister cave into the demands of the kidnapper? The end is skilfully filmed, and maybe there are DVD outtakes on this."
1,1, The episode that kept me for years from watching any more of Black Mirror,3.0,"After hearing about Black Mirror for a while, I thought I'd take a look, and took a look at the first episode. After 10 minutes I turned it off, although then mild curiosity lead me to read an online synopsis and took a quick look at the end. I didn't watch another episode for 4 years, because I couldn't see how anything that began so badly could possibly worthwhile. (Recently a friend who said this was the worst episode of the entire series convinced me to watch U.S.S. Callister, which was great, so now I'm ready to watch more).For me, National Anthem was a dismal fail. Basically it seemed to be a serious drama about an absurd situation. I actually started getting annoyed even before it got ridiculous because of the way the cabinet kept drawing things out for dramatic effect: Really? you're going to turn off a kidnapping tape in the middle to make some cryptic remarks before you let your boss the Prime Minister see the rest of it?Then the big twist came in and I was like, really?From what I've read there are other sensibility issues. Of course, satire doesn't have to make sense, but in spite of the premise, it isn't filmed like satire. And if you film it realistically, you need to give it a feel of realism, at least in the beginning (for example, Dr. Strangelove, which established a sense of reality before getting absurd). If the first five minutes had been done better, I wouldn't have been so put off by the central premise that I couldn't bring myself to continue.Why Black Mirror's makers felt this was the episode to start with is puzzling, although it's also puzzling why they would make it at all.If you haven't seen Black Mirror, don't start here."
1,1, Change the channel.,7.0,"'The National Anthem (2011)' is the first entry in Charlie Brooker's 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. It tells the tale of a kidnapper's unconventional and cruel demand: the prime minister must have sex with a pig on live TV. The piece starts out somewhat blackly comic, with the absurd request contrasting with the absolute sincerity with which it is treated. However, it soon becomes clear that this command is genuine and genuinely distressing. The experience escalates into a scrambled search for the kidnapper in an attempt to avoid what seems inevitable. The situation is properly tense and its culmination is properly disturbing. Rory Kinnear gives a great performance as a man pushed to the edge and the affair's pacing is veritably propulsive. It's not nice but it's compelling. It is also clearly trying to say something, which it does successfully without beating its audience over the head. Having said that, its observation does feel slightly 'empty'. It's not the most astute message but it works well enough. In the end, this is an entertaining - if not exactly enjoyable - short film with a dash of satire and a heap of horror. 7/10"
1,1, Pigs might fly,8.0,"This has to be one of the most eye-opening pieces of TV I've ever watched. The premise is shocking to the point of unbelievability but a whole lot easier to accept now that the life-imitating-art story of ex-P.M. Cameron's university capers with a porker has come to light. Basically, a young Prime Minister, with similarities to let's say Tony Blair or the afore-mentioned then P.M. in waiting Cameron is woken up by the shocking news that the popular princess of the day, with similarities to let's say Princess Diana, has been kidnapped apparently by terrorists whose sole demand for her release is that said P.M. must commit a sex-act on live T.V. with a pig.It's realistically shot in almost real-time, with social media fanning the flames as the story spreads, augmented by ""Breaking News"" CNN / Sky News-type television updates making more tense the looming four o'clock deadline for the P.M.'s moment of porcine truth. Behind the scenes, every possible way-out is gradually closed down to him and the fantastical finale proceeds with the twist in the tale (or should that be tail?) as the truth is revealed, in the process making sense of subtly inserted seemingly unrelated trivial premonitions in the lead-up.As a commentary on celebrity culture, the eroded public perception of the status of politicians, the limits of censorship and just what people will and won't watch on their TV screens it's savagely on point, even more so today with ever more invasive reality TV shows given ever more network time.A piece like this couldn't work unless two vital factors were in play, firstly that it's played arrow-straight by all the actors and also that there's leavening humour inserted too (evident even in the title of the episode, as we wonder whether the P.M. will get up for his monarch). Both these boxes are positively ticked leaving the only really exceptionable segment being where a female reporter has to sex-text images of herself to one of the P.M.'s insiders to get an exclusive. I wasn't totally convinced by the last scene either showing how the P.M and his wife were coping one year on as I didn't think it added anything to the story.That said, I watched it with one jaw gaping and the other laughing at what I was seeing. This really does feel like it's pushing at the limits of television political comedy but rather like the depiction here of the various representatives of the British public unable to resist tuning in to watch, just you try and look away from this one once you've started."
1,1, 9,9.0,It was so creepy and disturbing but also really entertaining at once. Really enjoyed first episode. Prime minister made the right decision.
1,1, What would you do?,8.0,"The princess was kidnapped. Via a YouTube video, the kidnapper demands that the Prime Minister have sexual intercourse with a pig in a live television broadcast, in exchange for the Princess' life. While police are trying to track him down, and the crisis staff monitors the reactions of the public, we observe the horrific dilemma of the Prime Minister who is slowly giving in to the pressure, until a complete breakdown.While the series is largely based on SF and futuristic premises, this episode is a purebred drama, quite possible at this very moment. The episode deals with the terrifying power that the Internet already possesses, the psychology of the masses, and the influence of the media on public opinion, questioning the policy of non-negotiation with terrorists, all through the prism of an individual in a hopeless situation.Although the script has some obvious flaws, and the episode somewhat flirts with black humor, the overall impression it leaves is deeply shocking, quite frightening, and thought-provoking.8/10."
1,1, Sex With A Pig,8.0,The Princess Susannah is kidnapped and her kidnapper had posted on YouTube a video. He wants the prime minister to have sex with a pig on live television.One of the reporters sexts photos of herself in the washroom. She goes into the supposed building where the princess is supposedly kept but instead gets shot by authority in the leg.The prime minister has no choice but to go ahead and do the act so he unzips his pants and we see him in his underwear. The pig is eating happily. He then performs the act and we see the audience's reaction.In the end the prime minister's approval rating has gone up a lot after one year but the only thing is his wife is not happy. She acts happy in front of the cameras but when they are home she stomps away. The princess is now pregnant.
1,1, An attention-grabber first episode,6.0,"I would not go as far as writing that I ""liked"" this episode, but for sure it attracted my attention.It works very well as a critique of a media-obsessed world, populated by hypocrites and voyeurs. It also strikes very close to our present situation and due to its dark nature, it is distubing. Likable, not so much, but definitely attention-grabbing."
1,1, Dare I say this might be a Marmite episode based on the reviews i have read!,10.0,"Boom!You can see from my rating how much I loved this episode. What a way to kickstart a new binge watch that I had been avoiding after seeing Bandersnatch last year!The National Anthem is a work of satirical art. It dared to suggest something so off the wall and ridiculous that it had me in shock and hysterics at the same time. It felt so fresh and original it drew me in and kept giving me more!I never believed for a second that the writers would actually see this through to it's conclusion, but hats off them, they dared to go there!Wow, all the craziness and satire was stripped away and replaced with something so perverse and sick I could really feel it! However uncomfortable it was to watch, I felt so sad for the lead character, sickened by the society, appauled by the reactions!For a story this silly to play out the way it does and still draw these emotions from the viewer has be the work of genius.Clearly many people hate this episode, I loved it!10/10"
1,1, What a Completely and Ridiculously Stupid Concept,1.0,I heard a lot of good things about this series and I had high hopes. If I can judge the series by S01E01 I would call it a disaster.People actually liked this episode? How is that possible? A kidnapped princess? I wouldn't wave to a camera to save a royal. Why didn't they make that royal pig have sex with the pig? If this is any indication of the quality of this series then I am getting out early.
1,1, The way we live now ... and it doesn't look too great,9.0,"In the first outing for Charlie Brooker's ""Dark Mirror"", a number of familiar-faced actors perform seriously and persuasively enough to capture the viewer within about 5 (of max 45) minutes, with a story presented seriously and realistically, and yet perfectly mixing the deadly serious with the eccentric and bizarre. It's a deeply British setting with just a hint of Doctor Who about it, and it homes in neatly on the tensions potentially and actually existing in the Prime Minister/British people/Royal Family triangle. Symbolic figureheads the Royal Family may be, but few in Britain have much doubt that - say - soldiers will ultimately do more to protect them than they will top politicians. In this case, it rather quickly becomes apparent that Brits expect a PM (and PM's wife) remarkably similar to David and Samantha Cameron to make a sacrifice for the sake of a young and popular Royal. The essence of this - in art here, as in real life - is just that the Royals are born into the job (whether they want to be or not), and in that sense somehow innocents, while politicians are elected and, if they can't stand the heat, they have no business being in politics in the first place.Anyway, what the kidnapper expects from the PM is bizarre (and all the more so given the apparently (truly) coincidental way in which life later (not until 2015, albeit retrospectively) apparently seemed to sort-of imitate art). In essence, it involves humiliation, and we immediately find ourselves wrongfooted by the fact that this terrorist demand - apparently associated with a genuine threat to the victim's life - does not involve money or deep political motives, but does require that the PM degrade himself publicly. It might be somehow funny or inconsequential in that case, but certainly does not seem so.The question mark here all the time is who is actually been targeted by the maker(s) of this piece, and the primary target would seem to be the electronically-connected world we live in. Certainly, there is tangible criticism for millions in the UK and around the world who are prepared to watch (and stay watching) the PM's humiliation, and in this sense - paradoxically - this modern, cutting-edge programme looks remarkably traditional in suggesting that the man at Number 10 is actually a hero who does the right (if nevertheless self-diminishing) thing.Happily, the kidnapper does not come out of this heroic, yet we still feel disturbed when we learn of his motive.Overall, it's clever and disturbing and dark, and definitely thought-provoking. It's also executed pretty deftly."
1,1, Strange beginnings,7.0,This review contains spoilers for the first episode of the first season of Black Mirror.The first episode of Black Mirror concerns a royal princess that is kidnapped with the ransom being the prime minister must have sex with a pig on live television. The episode covers the beginning from the ransom video being displayed to the revelation of the ransom. The British government is in panic as they seek to stop the media frenzy caused by the royal princess' kidnapping and ransom.The mystery of the episode is the best part. The revelation at the end being that the entire act was a work of art and reflection on modern society was great. This part elevated the episode for me and aided in the enjoyment of the episode.The characters of this episode are well-acted but the characters themselves are two-dimensional. Each character has a single motivation and that is all that carries them through the episode. The wife of the prime minister simply did not want her husband to engage in the act even when it was to save someone's life. It did seem like the episode should have focused more on the theme of the reflection on society rather than the focus on characters.The directing and editing are decent. The episode's visuals will not wow anyone but it will tell the story.I would recommend the first episode of the first season of Black MirrorGrade: B
1,1, The Power of Social Media,7.0,"Plot (3.5/5)Story (4/5)Soundtrack (4/5)They did it great.
Dialog (4.5/5)They speak way too fast.
Graphic (4/5)Reasonableness (5/5)All make sense.
Entertainment (3.5/5)Well, It is weird but also a bit entertaining.
Overall (4/5)This episode shows how powerful Social Media is. Even Government can't stop them."
1,1, He who laughs last,9.0,"I do believe that Mr Charlie Brooker no longer doing his 10 o'clock Live satirical news rival show decided that it would be great fun to do a story that attacked the then Prime Minister of Great Britain David Cameron.Cameron hated the comedians like Carr, Mitchell, Merton , Brooker etcBrooker didn't have time for The Tory partyEnjoy"
1,1, Degrading piece of garbage,1.0,"This program is described as being in the science fiction or thriller genre. Other people told me it was like a contemporary version of the twilight zone. None of these descriptions is remotely like what was presented in the first episode of the series. This episode is a twisted piece of filth that degrades the many British actors who lowered themselves to take part in it. It wasn't even much of a mystery, since there is a very clear spoiler early in the episode that gives away the name of the perpetrator. Don't waste your time. I will not be watching any more of this series. I wonder if this was written before or after the famous story about Prime Minister David Cameron and the pig."
1,1, Maybe something was lost in translation? Yank here.,2.0,"This is so bizarre and unpleasant to watch, it's amazing the show survived. I just wonder if there is a subtext here that Americans are missing."
1,1, Great start,8.0,"The satirical story is unsettling. Unlike the other episodes in Black Mirror, The National Anthem is set on the present and it deals with our obsession of social media and how news spreads like wildfire. And a PM doing it with a pig...really disturbing. But the acting is great."
1,1, Overrated,6.0,"I am giving this highly rated series a chance. This first episode was okay. I was entertained enough, but, it is nothing to write home about. It is also not as clever as it thinks it is. The internet has changed the world is hardly a radical new idea. There was also quite a lot of subtle political correctness which I didn't care for. The BBC is about as bad as it gets when it comes to that. So far I am interested enough in the show to give more episodes a chance, but, it has not yet won me over. Time for episode 2.P.S. I had to include a spoiler alert so I could include my thoughts. I would not have had sex with the pig. If I were the prime minister, I would not let a random psychopath, other slimy politicians, those unelected sponges the royals or the disgusting public tell me what to do. As it turns out, I would have made the right decision, because the guy had released her 30 mins before anyway. So I wouldn't have had to f*** a pig. That whiny princess would be let go and the crazy terrorist would be the only one harmed because he cut off his own finger. I also hate the PM's wife. She is really angry at him even though he didn't do anything to cause the situation. I hated that reporter the most. Luckily she got shot. That made me very happy."
1,2, Creative Second Effort,9.0,"This, of course, is an outrageous allegory about the foundations of our decline. The plot involves a man who seems to be comfortable. His bodily needs are taken care of. He seems somewhat free. But we soon find out that his daily routine is to get on a stationary bike and earn merits. These accumulate and can be exchanged for the the things that the governing body (whatever that is) is willing to sell them their products. They can get snacks from vending machines, watch pornography, mundane music, watch fat people being abused, on and on. They can also try to leave their station by giving up their merits in order to try to be celebrities themselves. It requires a huge number of merits (in the case 15 million) which could take six months to accumulate. Two people find each other and one makes a big sacrifice to allow that person to realize her dream. She must audition for three disgusting show-biz types in a kind of Hunger Games interview. We learn quickly that the decks are stacked and the prospect of pedaling a bicycle for eternity versus a modicum of celebrity is a hard decision. One of the most striking things about the episode is that people are represented to one another as avatars. When the girl sings in her audition, she sings before an arena full of cartoon figures who are the extension of real people. An excellent second episode after the first sickening one. I'll keep moving on to the third."
1,2, The Performances,6.0,"In a future society, most of the people work like slaves riding stationary bicycles to generate energy. In return, they receive ""merits"" that are consumed in fast-foods in vending machines and games and shows that they are forced to watch in giant screens in the single compartment where they live. When the worker Bingham ""Bing"" Madsen (Daniel Kaluuya) overhears his fellow worker Abi (Jessica Brown Findlay) singing in the unisex toilet, he falls in love with her. He convinces her to participate in the talent competition show ""Hot Shot"", where she may improve her life if she is selected by the judges Hope (Rupert Everett), Charity (Julia Davis) and Wraith (Ashley Thomas). Bing uses his savings of fifteen million merits that he had inherited from his brother to buy a ticket to Abi. However the judges offer to Abi to work in the porn channel ""Wraith Babes"" instead and she accepts the offer expecting to improve her life. Bing is angry with her choice and decides to save merits to go to the ""Hot Shot"" with a sharp piece of glass. What will he do in the contest? ""Fifteen Million Merits"" is a pointless episode of ""Black Mirror"" about a technological dystopia. The viewer sees the episode expecting something different and watches a weird story with an unintelligible speech. There is an obvious criticism to the excessive use of television, fast-food and video-games but the result is disappointing. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available on DVD or Blu-Ray"
1,2," ""I just want something real to happen. Just once.""",7.0,"Anybody here see and remember the movie ""The Running Man""? It starred Arnold Schwarzenneger and took place in a dystopian future in which the mindless masses were kept entertained with programs featuring blood and violence. You have pretty much the same thing here except the violence has been replaced by celebrity sex by players who pay their dues on the way to becoming the next 'Hot Shot'. All throughout, the story hints at the idea that the principal characters Abi (Jessica Brown Findlay) and Bing (Daniel Kaluuya) won't succumb to the relentless pressure of achieving that status, knowing that the only thing they each want to do is what makes them happy. But that choice is made impossible by celebrity judges Wraith, Hope, and Charity, who promise to send the fan favorites back to their lives of daily boredom scoring points while creating energy for the State and watching mind numbing programs of questionable value. An alternate ending in which Bing slashes his throat would have been considered more acceptable to this viewer, in as much as he seemed to be fiercely opposed to the choice he was offered, but in the end he too failed to deliver on his principles. Not that he had to be that drastic, he could simply have returned to his previous status. As Rod Serling once posited in one his more memorable Twilight Zone episodes, I guess it's all in the 'Eye of The Beholder'."
1,2," Seems so long ago, yet so prescient",8.0,"I still haven't seen Black Mirror season 3 onwards (I guess I have to subscribe to Netflix eventually). I'm only now catching up on three episodes from the early years: this and the third one in season 1, and the Christmas one with Jon Hamm.Fifteen Million Merits has several layers that is akin to a rorschach test. What you see depends on your priority in life. Consumerism? Capitalism? Talent shows? Simon Cowell? You have it all wen you see this."
1,2, I want to ride my bicycle.,8.0,"'Fifteen Million Merits (2011)' is the second entry in Charlie Brooker's 'Black Mirror (2011-). It's perhaps more typical of the series as a whole, with a single sci-fi premise at its core and a generally downbeat vibe. It's also highly satirical, a reflection of reality that's only become more relevant in the years since its initial release. Despite its heavy allegory and multi-faceted message, the piece remembers that it is, first and foremost, entertainment. As such, it's entertaining. It's also incredibly interesting and consistently compelling. It tells a fully-rounded story, with a tight script and a strong sense of design. The thing ties itself together wonderfully, culminating in an explosive finale that's truly great. Its first half, dedicated to establishing its world and setting up its extended meet-cute, is enjoyable and endearing. Its second, which is much darker, is straight-up gripping. You know something bad is going to happen but you really don't want it to, too invested in the central characters to care whether or not their suffering would make for better TV. It's really, really good. One of its best features is its star-making turn from leading man Kaluuya, which is still one of his best performances to date (it's not like he's ever given a bad one, though). His moment in the spotlight, as it were, is raw, visceral and properly powerful. It's a great end to a great experience. 8/10"
1,2, 7,7.0,"Basically the whole episode had an amazing idea which wasn't fulfilled 100 percent which is really sad. The idea about collecting coins like real life money buy stuffs is very nice but they should also add like when you have 0points you actually die in real life that would be more entertaining. The part when the girl was singing and became like just say ""web girl for cash"" was kind of hideous. She became to sing, she seemed to be very shy and thankfully she would never become ""web girl for cash"". The ending disappointed me when the main character grabbed the glass I was thinking he's going to kill jury but it ended miserably bad. So idea is great, fulfil was OK and ending was disaster. First episode was much better."
1,2, The Matrix vs The X Factor,8.0,"Today, more than ever, man is a slave - a slave to capitalism, consumerism, modern economy, and media brainwashing. We are trapped in a vicious circle of cash flow and our lives are spent paying bills, repaying loans, and constantly striving to stay afloat. The powerful manipulate our needs and satisfy them, probably largely unaware that, although on a different level, they themselves are trapped in the same game.With this satirical futuristic episode, ""Black Mirror"" brings this hopeless situation to an extreme, making the life of an individual completely meaningless. But the satire here is not achieved through humor, but through the depressing and uneasy atmosphere of the story of a society in which brainwashed individuals spend their lives producing electricity by endlessly turning the pedals, while virtual reality diverts their attention from general absurdity. And when a whiff of individuality and the will to change accidentally appears in one of them, they are effectively suffocated by skillful manipulation and the screw is freshly oiled and returned to the machinery.8/10."
1,2, Cycling Slave,8.0,"Bing is one of the many cyclers who do daily cycling to earn credits they can use to entertain and spend on themselves. He meets a woman who is blue-eyed and pretty. He hears her sing in the washroom and tells her he is going to gift her 12 million points. The girl gives Bing an origami penguin. They go to the competition together where the girl is made to take a drink and then sings. She is asked to lift up her shirt because he wants to see her titties. One of the judges insists she joins his show called Wraith Girls which is porn. The other white male judge agrees he would watch her and the woman says some girls might join to watch. The girl is taken to the show and Bing is in agony to see her in porn. Bing cycles to get to 15 million points and goes on the show, skipping the drink by using an old crumpled juice box. He threatens to kill himself with the shard of glass and says everything on his mind. The white male praises him and offers him a spot on his talk show. Bing takes it and gets to live in a beautiful white room with a wall showing the beautiful outdoors. He sips his orange juice."
1,2, Depressing but less creepy than episode n.1,7.0,"In the very near future (?), people spend their working hours in gyms watching stupid TV shows, to earn ""merits"" and become stars of those stupid shows. Besides being permanently stuck in the gym, they live in cubicles and even there they are forced to watch abysmally degrading entertainment, such as talent shows - wait a moment: this in not the future, this is right now....Anyway, the plot is about a guy who donates all his merits to a pretty girl, hoping she'll be the next talented singer to win a TV contest, but his plan backfires miserably.PS this episode reminded me of when I used to go to the gym and bike watching TV screens. Not my fondest memory...."
1,2, The revolution will be televised,8.0,"The world of Black Mirror is not one that anyone should want to live in. It's extremely bleak despite the technological advancements. This episode feels real to an extent, and that's what makes it great."
1,2, Beautiful Irony,8.0,This is one of the best if not the best episode about what Black Mirror is about. A clash of technology and human emotions. A great display of it.In the end it is truly ironic how the expression of emotions and calling the system out in a way results in turning and reinforcing the system. Intelligent and well ut together. Also the start of playing the recurring song Anyone. This is the episode that got me hooked on the series8.5/10
1,2," My least favourite episode of season 1, but it's still good",8.0,"Typically artsy and sylistic, you could say typically Black Mirror.Fifteen Million Merits is an entertaining ride that hits pretty hard at times. I love the satire and the darkness in this tale of a dystopian future where humans are little more than generators.Nothing to criticise here, strong characters and story, a solid episode!8/10"
1,2," Near-future dystopia, partly familiar-looking, partly with its own new forms of mediocrity and unpleasantness",9.0,"While the dystopia in this next offering of high-class and indeed mind-blowing British sci-fi obviously owes a debt to our country's ever-pertinent predecessor duo authoring ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"", Charlie Brooker does bring in certain inventive features all of his own here. And just like its ""Black Mirror"" predecessor episode ""National Anthem"", this one keeps allowing new ideas to unfold at each moment through to the very end, often surprising the viewer as this happens.In the meantime (and again in the same vein as with ""National Anthem"") we have multiple (conceivably even too many) targets having potshots taken at them, and the emotions come in thick and fast.The most Orwellian feature here is the sheer dullness of the everday existence presented. Nothing looks very high-class, and most things look artifiical, flashy, dumbed-down and childish - yet, while the people living this life do seem to have insight into this fact (certainly lead role Daniel Kaluuya as Bing seems to notice that ""everything is sh**""), and while they are not apparently forced to keep with this lowest common denominator by Big Brother/Thought Police/Room 101-like terror or even - most likely - by being drugged, as in the Huxley masterpiece, they do things as prescribed and play along...Why would that be?A clue may be provided with a further twist in the tale at the end, given the implication that these bits of human civilisation (if we can dignify what we see with that term) seem to exist in order to allow everywhere else beyond the confines of the centres we see to return to nature. That's a particularly paradoxical and chilling thought if the interpretation is correct.What price a restored environment?Yet this gels with the idea that the even-slightly-overweight are very much abused and looked down on in the society presented here - the implication being that they are taking more than their fair share of resources, or some such, and can to be mocked and abused for that.The beautiful and still-carefree 21-year-old Abi is an obvious reference to ""Julia"" in 1984, and of course she entrances Bing who is her Winston Smith. And just as Julia somehow lets Winston (and the reader) down in ""1984"", so the gorgeous Jessica Brown Findlay in the role of Abi accepts - very reluctantly, under merciless audience pressure, but nevertheless - that her lucrative, privileged if demeaning place will be in porn, rather than singing. Bing is similarly broken by this system (again a la Winston Smith), the thing being all-encompassing enough to allow him to preach a toned-down version of his diatribes against that very system as a new form of paid-for entertainment within the system framework!!And, this being ""Black Mirror"", the fact that Abi and Bing both escape the daily grind and go on to higher, more elite things DOES NOT mean them getting back together to rekindle the wonderfully inspiring love that they have experienced briefly.So all is miserable and maudlin once again, but certainly thought-provoking enough.Perhaps tyrannical discipline is really not needed in a world where people have nothing to spend unless they first exercise-cycle their way through energy production, then buy meagre rations and dire entertainment before starting the next bout of exercising ad nauseam.Indeed, much of that entertainment in its commercial aspect they will continue to receive UNLESS they pay ""merits"" NOT to receive it - a tragic and terribly scary twist denoting a default position in which everybody is soused with advertising or commercial pressures and content, unless they can afford not to be."
1,2, Monetary merits,7.0,"This review contains spoilers for the second episode of Black Mirror entitled ""Fifteen Million Merits.""The episode focuses on a society that is enclosed and automated Citizens here are frequently bombarded with advertisements. The most fit members of society that have not been elevated to the television generate power on stationary bikes for merit points. These merit points are used as currency.The episode focuses on Bingham ""Bing"" Madsen played by Daniel Kaluuya. The audience follows Bing as he navigates this strange world. The only way of elevating one's standing in the society is a ticket to being a hotshot where one performs in front of judges.This is a well written, well shot, and well edited episode. The episode flowed the freely and showed a dystopian society that had influences from Brave New World. Even the ending with a disillusioned Bing joining the very system he disagreed with is good writing.I highly recommend the second episode of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
1,2, This story as the X factor,9.0,Yep a story of many a twist and a novel way to create power source without any wars over oil.But when it comes down to the crunch how much is your morality and self respect worth?Get used to a certain tune
1,2, This is Art,9.0,Cycling continuously and earning points was so similar to us being in mundane jobs and accumulating points to pay off our bills. Even when we accumulate enough points and buy the golden ticket; we do not actually get what we were hoping for. We humans have made a viscous circle for ourselves that we can never escape from.
1,2, Very futuristic,8.0,"This is by far the most futuristic and eccentric episode. It is a satire of live TV contest shows. Like many of Black Mirror episodes, the story is also kinda creepy. Daniel Kaluuya is the star of this episode, and he's fantastic...and he's also hot."
1,2, All Style No Substance,3.0,"First of all, I will freely concede that the visuals of this episode look great. Overall I am still not impressed. I was told that this was supposed to be one of the best episodes. My main two objections are as follows. It moves way too slowly. There is lots of dull drawn out mundane and unnecessary parts. You could cut at least 15 - 20 mins and lose nothing significant. My larger objection is that the concepts and metaphors are not nearly as grand and intelligent as the critics seem to think. We are becoming slaves to technology... really? is that your high minded and profound social and political message? In some sense I do agree, but, this is not the cutting edge and brilliant art I was told to expect. I'm giving this show one more episode. If that does not impress me I am done. So far I think Black Mirror is completely overrated."
1,2, Dislike,5.0,Could be seen as an irony to capitalist ladder and all. But not worth 60 minutes. The universe is totally absurd and unrelatable for me.
1,2," Same Old ""Rats in a Race"" Concept",1.0,Same idea we've seen on other shows miilion times before. They didn't even do it well and the episode was way too long.
1,2, Absolutely Great!,9.0,"One of the greatest episodes of Black Mirror, just shows the genius of this show."
1,2, A Visually treat to watch this episode. 😍,8.0,"Wow.. Such a Nice world represented here in this episode.. According to the episode in the future Technology is pretty much advanced and people just tired with real money, so they're now dealing with Merit points and advertising industry have grown up so much there.
Nothing much to reveal about the storyline, but I'll say I just liked that ""Get Out"" Guy! Loved his acting and especially Dances and his epic Speech."
1,3, Where Does Humanity End?,9.0,"After one accepts the technology presented here, we get to see just how dangerous it is. People are able to recall every event of their existence--the images absorbed by an implant that more than half of society uses. People become obsessed with the gizmo and soon are sharing life events. The logical evolution of Facebook. But we are fragile figures. We still have emotions and we make mistakes. The main character is incredibly jealous of his wife's past. She is far from guiltless, but if one had to live with a paranoic, it wouldn't be hard to see things moving in the direction presented here. He comes home early from an interview and attends a dinner party his wife had thrown. In the mix is a man who seems to have more interest in the wife than the husband finds acceptable. With this ability to review the events of the past, he begins to search images. It's not that simple because there is subterfuge at every turn. This is another quite fascinating offering."
1,3, The Price of an Eternal Memory,8.0,"In the future, most of the population has a chip called Grain implanted to record and watch the memory of the entire life. After a job interview, the lawyer Liam Foxwell (Toby Kebbell) takes an earlier flight to meet his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker) in a dinner party with her old friends. When he unexpectedly arrives, Ffion is talking to her friend Jonas (Tom Cullen) and Liam finds her reaction strange. Then he watches her glances at Jonas during the dinner and he suspects they have a love affair. Liam presses his wife for an answer and she admits that Jonas and she had a love affair in Marrakesh before she meets Liam. They have sex and Liam spends the night drinking and reviewing the reunion. On the next morning, he drives to the house of Jonas and confronts him. What will be the price of his obsession?""The Entire History of You"" is another dark episode of ""Dark Mirror"", with a criticism to the excessive use of technology. What could be an argument between husband and wife becomes an obsession with the playback of past memories destroying their marriage. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not available"
1,3, 'Memory is for the living'.,7.0,"Does anyone doubt this is where we're actually headed? The only question I have is whether it will be voluntary or mandatory. Personally, I'm not even a Facebook user believing that it's membership requirements are too intrusive, but with the 'grain' implant, nothing in your life would be left to the imagination. You could simply call up your past experiences and be entertained or disgusted by them as the case may be. In Liam's (Toby Kebbell) case, he can't get past the idea that his wife (Jodie Whittaker) cheated on him and lied about it. I guess that's where the erasure option would be a good thing if you can call it that. Still, it would be a lot better to go against the grain in the first place instead of having to opt out at a later time."
1,3, Powerful story of who's your daddy - reminiscent of a real life Australian political sex scandal,9.0,"I'm finally catching up with the earlier episodes of Black Mirror. This searing episode is dramatic for sure, and is reminiscent of a real-life political sex scandal in Australia that was reported just a year before the screening of this episode.Thanks to grain technology where memories are stored (and deleted) and watched over and over again, Liam (a powerful performance by Toby Kebbell) suspects his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker, a few years before she become Dr Who) is having an affair with Jonas (Tom Cullen). Ffion and Jonas had a six month relationship before she connected with Liam.Through the grains, it turns out Ffion had a one night stand with Jonas around 9 months before the birth of her baby. Yes, Jonas is the daddy. This is reminiscent of the widely reported political sex scandal in Australia from 2010 where a guy, David Kuta, learned that his partner, Stephanie Hesford (who worked in Parliament) had an affair with member of parliament Kerry Hickey. Later Stephanie gave birth to a bouncing baby daughter, and David naturally thought he was the proud father...until he discovered the horrible truth that Kerry was the daddy.I felt sorry for Liam in this episode. I wonder what happened afterwards? Did Ffion and her daughter end up moving in with Jonas?"
1,3, Smile; you're on camera.,8.0,"'The Entire History Of You (2011)' finishes off the stellar first series of Charlie Brooker's 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. It uses its sci-fi premise to explore themes of jealousy, obsession and lies. In a world where absolutely everything is caught on camera, how can anyone even attempt to deceive? It's an interesting premise that's used as an entryway into its central character's relationship problems, which is an unexpected and equally as intriguing approach to the concept. Once everything has been set up, the piece spirals out of control and puts ever-changing distance between us and the protagonist by having him be unreasonable yet right. This delicate balance is preserved all the way until the end, which sees our hero at his most self aware. The strong performances from its flawed leads imbue the domestic proceedings with a real sense of urgency and desperation. In the end, short is compelling, well-written and entertaining. It's never quite what it appears to be. 8/10"
1,3, 7,7.0,Well for me it was too much of drama instead of interesting plot. The idea was good but it wasn't fulfilled.
1,3," ""Not everything that isn't true is a lie""",7.0,"In the undefined but near future, people have memory implants that record everything we see and hear, so we can access a detailed reproduction of every previous experience at any time, or share it with others on any screen available.One can no longer forget anything, but neither to hide. However useful and fun certain applications of this implant are for the individual, as well as for society as a whole, because, for example, they greatly facilitate police investigations, possibilities of abuse are endless. Sticking to the most beautiful memories becomes a modern form of addiction, missing the present because of living in the past, invading other people's privacy and intimacy, those are just some of them.Whether the positive aspects are worth the negative ones and how ethical and cost-effective this violation of privacy is, viewers have the opportunity to judge for themselves on the example of a couple whose marriage is falling apart, because the past no longer remains in the past, nothing falls into oblivion and time does not heal all wounds anymore.The premise is interesting, quite intimidating, and definitely calls for self-reflection. But, despite the good acting, the episode, compared to the previous ones, left a pale impression, because a strong premise was used for a relatively weak or maybe just insufficiently elaborated story. The potential of this idea could have been much better exploited.7/10."
1,3, Season One,7.0,"The trouble with most anthology shows (especially those that deal with the future, mystery, or technology) is that eventually they get compared to The Twilight Zone and come up lacking. An impossible standard, of course, but one that exists to this day (just showing how far ahead of its time that show was).This first, three-episode season of Black Mirror tackles similar themes as Rod Serling's TZ, only focusing on technology-based themes of this modern era. The themes of this season include:-A prime minister effectively blackmailed into a horrendous act by terrorism and social media.
-A future in which humans are little more than ad-watching, avatar-updating, electricity-producing slaves, with the only escape being an Idol-like reality show.
-A couple who have brain implants allowing them to remember and review every life act...for better or worse.By and large, the themes of Black Mirror are interesting and relevant. I found the first two episodes (especially the second one) to be a bit tedious, but the third one is excellent. That's why I can only give this First Season a 3.5 star rating.Overall, though, this proved to be an interesting enough concept for me to want to continue. I really enjoy television that makes me think, and that is the point of Black Mirror. I think (hope) the finale effort here marks a conscious effort to make sure the characters are as front-and-center as the concepts, which wasn't necessarily the case with the first two eps."
1,3, Keeping Memories Forever?,9.0,"A man goes through customs and shows his memories to prove he has done nothing criminal. He goes to a party and sees his wife chatting with Jonas. Jonas, a man who makes disgusting jokes about using his implanted device that holds his memories to look back at sexy times with women gives a bad impression on the man. The man suspects his wife has something for Jonas. He rewinds the night and sees how his wife smiles at Jonas but when faced to him the sparkle in her eyes are not there. His wife admits she had a 6-month relationship with Jonas previously. But she complains why are they digging up skeletons before their marriage. Everyone has skeletons she says even her husband with a woman she names. Later they have sex together that night.The man goes over to Jonas's and demands he deletes all footage of his wife. He does not want Jonas masturbating to his wife. However one detail catches his eye and he goes home to show his wife. He confronts his wife about a more recent video that took place in their bedroom. She claims it was nothing but the man demands she pulls up her memories. She tries to delete secretly but her husband is quick to catch on. Her husband asks her if the baby is his. She says yes. She admits Jonas and her had sex when they were in a week-long fight. Her husband asks if they used a condom and she says yes. He demands she pull up the recording and she does so.The husband is now in an empty house. Looks like he is no longer with his wife - she is his ex. He gouges out he memory implant."
1,3, Some memories are best forgotten,7.0,"If we ever needed proof that some technology is not of help.... this episode shows how keeping ALL your memories can ultimately unravel your life.From the very start we have the main character obsessing about his interview and literally playing it over and over gain, trying to guess what the interviewrs thought and if he did something wrong.After having joined his friends for dinner, he starts obsessing about his wife and one of the other guests. One may object that maybe this guy would obsess no matter what, but for sure having technological support to enable his addiction/weakness is not helping.Further investigation into his wife's past proves to be disastrous. Do one really need to know the truth at all costs?"
1,3, Devastating,9.0,Wow. This is a really really great episode of television. It's fairly simple yet extremely effective in the presentation and execution. Razor sharp.
1,3," Tragically sad, yet very engaging!",9.0,"The entire history of you plays with the concept that we all record everything that we see. We can replay any event and analyse it, display for others to see, relive our greatest moments! Sounds cool doesn't it?It isn't!It serves to breed paranoia, suspision, doubt, anger, hate, pain, and anguish!Brilliant invention that inevitably undermines the human condition and exposes its flaws.Thought-provoking and clever throughout, this episode is great!9/10"
1,3, Betrayal of love revealed thanks to constant life-recording technology,8.0,"Long ago, my young-teenage visits to my great aunt's house were enlivened by over-the-yard-wall quality time spent - increasingly enjoyably (and from my side increasingly romantically) with the girl next door. It was a somehow-remote place, and I long went without competition, grew blasé and stuck in the groove, if blissfully ""in control"" of what seemed an increasingly-fortuitous situation. Then one day, I went into the yard to find the said girl with 2 or 3 other guys older, wiser and (presumably) less boring and unadventurous than I. The girl found their company stimulating and hilarious, and all the more so when they turned their attention to mocking me. There was nowhere much to hide, and the loss of security and (exaggerated) sense of betrayal hurt terribly, and very soon generated a huge desire in me to hurt back ... which in practice I had zero capacity to do.Many a man who has allowed himself to soften through love, to let down his emotional guard and become dependent, has met this situation, and while women of course suffer when men are unfaithful to them, a man plagued by a powerful (and absurd) mix of territoriality, pride and self-doubting vulnerability can simply go to pieces in situations where a loved female decides for whatever reason (and often with surprising calculation) ""to spread it around"".If my above scenario was fortunate, it was in the fact that the revelation as to my inadequacy to hold on to someone I (believed I) cared about was quick and abrupt. This is not the case for The Entire History of You's Liam (played by Toby Kebbell) - a not-especially-sympathetic figure whose agony is nevertheless real and prolonged as he gradually realises how much he has been lied to by his ostensibly (and probably actually) loving wife (played very well by Jodie Whittaker), who nevertheless betrayed Liam with an old flame within hours of Liam's brief departure after a tiff. Wife Ffion does seem regretful, but to this day gives body-language and giggly clues that ""other guy"" Jonas remains ""forbidden fruit"" intriguing to her.And how does Liam see the evidence for this? And how does he come to dwell on this and little else? Because he replays and replays, slows down, stops and enlarges the ""footage"" recorded through his own eyes thanks to an implant called a grain. Raging, he also then accesses Jonas's recordings, and those of his wife, to gain a fuller and fuller picture.In a dinner-party context we are first given a few varied hint-insights into how a world in which such implanted grains are reasonably widespread works; but ultimately the implications are mainly considered in regard to the above love-triangle only. This is then an elemental juxtaposition of a story that is as old as the hills, and extremely familiar (even somewhat to myself in the above manner) with extreme high tech. It's also interesting that, in most other respects, the world we see here resembles ours (hence a touch of the ""Never Let Me Go"" scenario, whereby several areas of technological and cultural development are rather stuck in the doldrums, while one field has leapt forward beyond what we in the familiar world have accomplished).""The Entire History..."" is thus presented as an alternate reality, rather than especially the future.Obviously, this idea also gained exploration in ""The Final Cut"" (of 2004) with Robin Williams - a fine film that decided to consider the implications for far more serious crimes and misdemeanours than we get in this ""Black Mirror"" instalment not for once involving Charlie Brooker. While Liam does drink and look potentially violent and off-the-handle, his deployment of the technology is at this stage a desperate and anguished one as much as anything, and it raises the question as to whether some things might be best left unrecorded and hence unknown. But in the world of this episode, there is nowhere much to hide from what has been recorded, and the temptation to look back at unhelpful and self-hurting things proves just as great as the temptation to relive moments of life-changing importance or joy. Basically, Liam and his life fall apart rather rapidly.Is this actually the best or most-telling way of illustrating what a world operating on the basis of everything being recorded would be like?I'm not quite sure.But do we feel something as Liam faces the sick, cold, out-of-control realisation that a wife he idolises has let him down and is still only prepared to release information in snippets that mostly contradict what she has said before?Well of course we do - and it's both uncomfortable watching and (in fact typically for ""Black Mirror"") also rather profoundly sad."
1,3, Perfect memory,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.The third episode of Black Mirror concerns an upper class society with grain implants that allow them perfect memory they can play on a screen or on their eyes. The grain allows them to recall any part of their memory in perfect detail. The story in this episode concerns Liam Foxwell that has his jealousy of his wife's flirtations amplified by the grain technology.Similar to the previous two episodes in the season, The Entire History of You' sets up the world in the opening minutes. It even has a discussion about grains in the dinner party and its implications. The episode does a great job with setting the stage for the grain usageThe episode does not do that well in its depiction of Liam Foxwell's jealousy of Ffion Foxwell's flirtations with Jonas. It was obvious from the beginning that Liam's overly concerning nature would cause jealousy. That was not as exciting to watch as the ramifications of the grain's usage was. It was obvious that Liam's overly analytical nature would cause everything to be dug up.The episode does have good scenes in showing the destruction that the grains inadvertently cause. This is worth the price of watching the episode. I would recommend ""The Entire History of You"".Grade: BBlack Mirror Season OneBlack Mirror is an anthological television series that focuses on alternate presents, or near futures. The episodes are stand-alone and focus on science fiction concepts that talks about the a change in today's society or another dystopian future.The first season contains three episodes of about fifty minutes long. Each episode does not relate to one another. Each of the episodes have good production values. All of the episodes have different directors, and casts. The direction across all of the episodes is good with the mise en scene being well done to contribute to the story.The writing is the main draw in this series and season. The three episodes in the first season are drastically different from one another. The first episode focuses on the a a ransom with the most connection to contemporary society. The second episode's focus is on a dystopian society that uses merit points as currency. The third episode is a near-future where the inhabitants have recorded memories through an implanted device.I highly recommend the first season of Black Mirror. The season offers the same' thrills as the Twilight Zone in the past.Grade: A"
1,3, An astounding introduction into the mirror,10.0,"This was the 1st one i watched even if i kept on delaying my viewing pleasure until December 2018 😯 . It set a marker and to be fair many that follow still hit the spot.The 2nd time around is where you really notice that not only are these individual masterpieces that are set in different time zones , cities etc which btw are not mentioned so we never know exactly where we are, but all stories tend to link in one way or another so keep your eyes open and ears on full."
1,3, Most relatable thing i think ive ever seen,10.0,"EDIT: Even watching it for about 5th time still great and no change in stars.How many times have you been in that moment when you wish that you could show your other half what they said ?
How many times do you wish you could prove that you did remind them to let the cat out ?Or what about stuff at work ? University? Prove what the police officer said when he pulled you over ?But more important prove to your loved one that you are right.The grain gives humans this ability, yeah world problems solved ! Yes ?No ! Of course not ! What sounds perfect would be a complete head **** in reality.And throughout this episode you see our prototype tormented not blessed with the tech.A step to far. Indeed"
1,3, Brilliant and at times difficult and painful to watch,9.0,"Some people say that ""we are defined by our memories"" and that ""without memory we would lack any perspective"" with which to assess the world. Others say that ""memories are meant to fade."" and that ""time heals all wounds.""What if we lived in a world where memories literally own us and where they never, ever fade and are accessible in high definition and slow motion replay... Forever to anyone?
What if they could be stored and digitised... or even traded as a commodity?
What would memories become then?They would become our most prized possessions: More irreplaceable than hand-crafted treasures, more valuable than any diamond or gold. Imagine, our very essence and experiences captured (and with liberal editing) all the best parts distilled into a narcotic, addictive stream of consciousness, on tap wherever and whenever we desire.We could go back, time and time again to revisit out best experiences. We could show these details at will to others on any available screen. Alternatively, we could expunge forever that which we never wish to see again, and be forever distrusted as someone with no proof of what they've done or where they've been...Or, we could even keep those most painful moments it as a lash with which to whip ourselves while saying a dozen Hail Marys.This is the story of a family that live in such a world, where things once experienced can be recorded forever and used to wager a strategic, rightful war on those around us. But at what cost to ourselves and our relationships?"
1,3, Never Forget,9.0,"I always wondered what if our memories are saved or viewed? Finally, an episode about this.In the future, forgetting is not on the dictionary. They're recorded somehow and you can view it anytime, anywhere. Fantastic as it may seem, it has consequences.Really great episode and love the drama and all."
1,3, Relatable,10.0,"Very plausible and futuristic approach. Not as in aspiring term, but in actual realistic way we behave currently as well."
1,3, Grains and re-dos are more trouble than they're worth,10.0,"This Black Mirror episode was released in 2011, at the cusp of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. mania, so at the time, the technology depicted in this episode did still feel a bit distant and futuristic. Five years later in 2016 was when I actually stumbled upon this series. Watching ""The Entire History of You"" for the first time, I was very impressed yet still somewhat shrugged it off as another sci-fi fear mongering. Well now, another five years later, in 2021, I watched the episode again and was blown away by this masterpiece. The future depicted ten years ago is fast approaching now. Given the choice, the average person now is likely to sign up to have that ""grain"" installed in a heartbeat. It's a much more convenient way of capturing their lives the way they obsessively record everything now on all social media platforms. Privacy is out the window. This accelerated embrace of technology neglects the spontaneity of life and the natural human limitations designed keep our brains sane and functional. Some memories are meant to fade, and life's mundane events are not meant to be recalled play-by-play. Most of all, cherish the idea that today, the thoughts in your mind are still 100% yours. You think what you think, and nobody can force you to play a re-do of it. The way things are going though, it's probably only a matter of time when your thoughts can be put on a show for everyone to watch. And therein lies the true horror."
1,3, Wonderful Representation of Near Future.,8.0,"Nothing will Hide in the near future.
Basically I personally liked this concept of recording every single things which comes in front of our eyes.
I was wondered about this idea since I was a child.
Ha ha Jokes apart.
This technology is great to adapt but but but this can cause lots of damage in our relationship... Yeah you heard it right dude.. In this 21st century we've already watched lots of complications in couples relationship whether they married or not, but if this technology came anyhow in near future what will gonna happen, it's a clear example with this episode..Simply 8 Stars from my side."
1,3, Classical trope mixed with relevant issues,7.0,"Classical story about infidelity with problematic technology on top. Blurring of lines of online and offline life, devalvation of relationships and social skills, chips, infiltration of privacy in order to enforce security, inability to let the past go... All these problems are happening even today, this episode just pushes this phenomenon (quite) a bit further."
2,4, You might think you'd love to have your dead loved ones back....,7.0,"When the show begins, Martha and Ash seem to have a lovely life and the couple are clearly in love. However, after Ash leaves and fails to return, she soon learns the worst...he was killed in an accident. Martha is inconsolable but a pushy friend insists that she knows something that can help Martha work through her grief. Martha is NOT interested but after receiving a strange email, she investigates and learns that this same friend signed her up for a most unusual service...one that recreates your loved one based on their Facebook posts, emails and videos. Soon, Ash is alive...or at least a computer simulation of him. But there's far more to it than that...
Like almost every episode of ""Black Mirror"", this show examines current and near future technological advances and trends and tries to predict the dark side of their use. Very clever and well worth see, but I am deducting a point because the show did something I HATE and which is sadly too common...a closeup of a person barfing. Ugghhh...we don't need that."
2,4, Too Many Issues,7.0,"The premise to this was interesting. When a woman's husband dies, she goes into the deepest of depressions. A friend puts her onto a website which takes all his internet interactions and recreates him. Of course, it is limited to the data available. So one day, she takes the next step which is to buy, at great expense, a model of him that has the same gifts. She is excited at first but then begins to realize how sick this all is. What can she do. The possibilities are just to complex and she must take a dramatic turn."
2,4, Appearance vs. Individuality,7.0,"The youths Martha (Hayley Atwell) and Ash (Domhnall Gleeson) are deeply in love with each other and move in together to a house in the countryside. On the next morning, Ash drives the van they hired for the relocation back to the rental, but he has an accident and dies. During the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah (Sinead Matthews) tells her about a service to help grieving people to recover, creating a virtual Ash to communicate with her from the information available in social networks and Internet. Martha cries to Sarah and does not accept the idea. However, Sarah subscribes Martha to the service and she receives and e- mail from Ash and has an argument with Sarah. A few days later, Martha learns that she is pregnant and she does not succeed in contacting her sister Naomi (Claire Keelan). She responds Ash's e-mail and they start a relationship through e-mail first and through cell phone later. One day, Ash offers an experimental and expensive service to Martha and she receives a synthetic body identical to Ash. When Martha activates the clone, she finds an identical Ash and they have sex. Will she replace Ash by the clone?""Be Right Back"" is an interesting show of ""Black Mirror', with a story about appearance and individuality and scary application of artificial intelligence. The concept of using robots or clones to replace the partner is not original (see ""Cherry 2000"", for example), but ""Be Right Back"" shows much more. For example, the quantity of information about a person available in the social networks and internet that is sufficient to trace not only a profile, but also a shape. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not available"
2,4, Very moving. Very good episode.,8.0,"Hayley Atwell shines through in this thoroughly moving, heart wrenching tale of love and grief. Brooker proves that he can tug at the heart strings as well as entertain, as he takes you on a journey of tragedy and longing. The scary thing about this episode is I believe one day they'll have the technology to have something similar to the voice activated thoughts and conversations of someone deceased.I love the futuristic touches, such as the desktop and the car, really nice glimpses into a possible future.It's not an episode I'd be inclined to watch over, like San Junipero or Hang the DJ, but it serves as a really engaging, moving piece."
2,4," ""I wish I was there with you now.""",8.0,"It's interesting to see how television programs and movies keep pace with technology. Back in 1961, when the most advanced form of person to person communication relied on a dial telephone, the Twilight Zone episode 'Long Distance Call' had a recently departed grandmother talk to her grandson via a toy phone she gave him before she passed on. That story had a sinister element, in that the grandmother tried to talk the boy into joining her on the other side via suicide. Rod Serling recycled that theme later on in a fifth season episode titled 'Night Call', another venture into the nether regions between reality and the supernatural.There were so many ways this story could have gone, and after Martha (Hayley Atwell) took the step of bringing Ash (Domnhall Gleeson) back to some semblance of 'resurrection', I thought she might have gone the suicide route to put her on the same plane of existence as her former boyfriend. Her pregnancy obviated that idea, but I'm wondering why she would not have been creeped out by the whole idea of a dead person 'coming back to life'. Sure there was that initial reaction of shock, but I'm not so sure eventual acceptance would have led to having sex with a faux Ash. So chalk one up for the developing sexbot industry here. If I had to guess, since I haven't seen all the Black Mirror episodes yet, there's probably one dealing with that subject as well. Or there will be."
2,4, Very mature and moving,8.0,"Hayley Atwell and Domhnall Gleeson are superb and sublime in this season 2 episode of Black Mirror. It's very emotional, and demonstrates Charlie Brooker's enormous range in writing. I'm surprised this doesn't have more iMDB votes and user reviews. Still, definitely worth watching. Rod Serling would be proud for sure."
2,4, Define online.,7.0,"'Be Right Back (2013)' is the first entry in the second series of 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. Despite continuing the series' trend of exploring what happens when we push technology to the max, the piece is a decidedly character-focused affair. The central sci-fi premise almost doesn't matter; the thing is, first and foremost, an exploration of grief. It sets up an incredibly realistic, somewhat unconventional romance (in that it looks nothing like most Hollywood love affairs) and devastatingly wrenches it from you without any real flair. One minute, it's there; the next, it's not. The film works really well, balancing its existential questions with its beat-by-beat plot. It's well-written, considered and compelling. It has a unique premise and solid execution. 7/10"
2,4, 8,8.0,Well as the beginning of second season it wasn't as good as first start but the ending was creepier than I though so it earns extra point from me.
2,4," ""Imagine if it would have ended with the second-to-last scene.""",7.0,"In a car accident, a young woman loses her fiancé, a heavy addict to the Internet and social networks. This loss leaves her broken, especially when she realizes that she is pregnant. At the funeral, she learns about the software which, if it is given access to the deceased's internet accounts, can quite convincingly imitate him and thus enable the illusion of a conversation with a loved one. Although the idea was initially repulsive, when she tried the software, she quickly got hooked and distanced herself from the outside world. And then, after a while, she went one step further ...Although the episode eventually enters a serious SF, the initial premise is not far from our current reality, so it is easy to identify with this story. Additional strength is given by the excellent performance of Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter from Marvel movies and series). Her partner Domhnall Gleeson is also good, although this role does not give him too much space to show off.The story and atmosphere at first irresistibly reminded me of the movie ""Her"" (which, admittedly, was made later), which is definitely a plus for me, but later the episode loses its persuasiveness, which culminates in the last scene that unnecessarily spoils the overall impression.7/10."
2,4, Robot Lover,8.0,Martha and her husband are a beautiful couple. Their GPS is super cool. They have sex that night.Martha's husband passed away after taking the truck back to the rental. It is not explained how died. A woman suggests communicating with a cloud that can replicate her husband by taking everything associated with him technically.Martha is told by the cloud about an option that is not cheap. She gets a big package and opens it. It is a plastic body. She puts it in the bath and puts in electrolytes. The robot comes alive.Martha touches his face and takes off her top. She places his hand on her tit and he has no sexual response. She squeezes his penis and he replies he can turn that on and off automatically. So they end up having sex. Martha asks how did he learn all these moves and he says through porn.Martha eventually comes to the realization after her sister comes to visit that he will never truly replace her husband. She takes him to a cliff and orders him to jump.Fast forward and she has a daughter. The robot is kept in the attic and the daughter brings her cake up.
2,4, Creepy and disturbing,6.0,"Most of us have issues dealing with grief. The point everybody agrees about is that there are no shortcuts and that we need time to ""move on"".But what if technology would give us a chance to stay were we are? I can see lots of morbid developments, of which this episode is a chilling example.Freshly widowed Martha discovers she is pregnant and she is desperate to communicate the news to her deceased partner, Ash. A new ""service"" allows her to create an account based on Ash's presence on social media. Martha can now ""phone"" Ash and talk to him.Some additional - creepy - technology allows her to create a copy of Ash, but guess what? A replica is not like the real thing and Martha realises a bit too late that she is stuck with something that looks like Ash, but is not quite the same.So, when is it time to let go, if you can hold on forever?"
2,4, Good but not perfect!,8.0,"Be right Back is a great concept, but there was something missing that I am struggling to put into words here?Don't get me wrong, it is a good episode that realistically toys with a very chilling concept that, in part, may be somewhere in our future (Scary thought!)I think the first two thirds of this story played out better than the final third, maybe it went a little too far and became less scary rather than terrifying!As much as I enjoyed this, I was left wanting a little more.8/10"
2,4," More-conventional, minimalist, instalment, but certainly relevant/important",9.0,"""Be Right Back"" contrasts with its predecessors in looking more accessible from our standpoint (and hence more realistically threatening), if still presumably an alternative reality, since car technology that we have now here contrasts with higher tech - including the one that allows a dead person to be recreated on-screen or as a voice - on the basis of their online presence, phone calls, etc., and ultimately even moulded into corporeal form if a customer so wishes.Hayley Atwell as Martha does so wish, and is quite delightfully corporeal; and viewers like myself may be judgmental (jealous!) enough to regard as her a bit too hot for Domhnall Gleeson's Ash. But she's devoted to him anyway, and so is heartbroken when he takes the car out (from the inherited childhood home of his they are now residing in?) and never returns.And it's not academic in plot terms that the recreated version of Ash proves a FAR better lover physically for Martha than his flesh-and-blood predecessor. This is is the naughtiest moment of an episode suffused with an indefinable but tangible eroticism, and Martha's initial need for any contact having faced such sudden loss rather rapidly gives way to a need for physicality - satisfying for her even as it rapidly makes her aware that this is NOT the real Ash!The disparities only multiply (as of course they would) as time passes, and the stress of ""having"" but ""not having"" reaches a crescendo quite rapidly at Beachy Head or somewhere similar! A wonderfully dramatic and poignant moment that easily could have gone one of several ways.That that moment dissipates in the way it does proves powerful stuff, and leaves it abundantly - remarkably - clear that Martha has regained control of the situation, accommodated to it, and done something that offers far more for her and her daughter than it offers ""Ash"".Martha is therefore first bereaved and definitely the victim, and we out here can't help feeling that Ash's geeky absent-mindedness might somewhere down the line have contributed to her being in that situation. She then goes through various stages of disgust, outrage, utilisation, advantage-taking, disillusionment, anger, disgust again, accommodation and possibly exploitation. It's a roller-coaster therefore, but also one harking back to other films we've seen in which ""android rights"" can be trampled on as we see fit. Android Ash did not ask to be created, creeped Martha out in spite of everything, yet ended up with a confined shadow existence because - in the end - that was the best she could (or chose to) (or felt compelled to) offer him.Maybe ""he"" cares not, or maybe he does? And maybe the ""real"" Ash is up there in heaven wondering how he had so little to say about his ""re-creation""?If you're thinking from this description that Hayley Atwell runs this show, that's probably correct. But if you're thinking that means that Domhnall Gleeson does little, that's wrong. His acting in the ""dual"" roles is in fact fine and nuanced indeed.Overall, another EXTREMELY thought-provoking - if indeed ""dark"" - setup.Well done!"
2,4," Pretty Generic, Yet Pretty Neat!",7.0,"Familiar yet interesting concept. Superbly executed with a top-notch direction, and superb acting, especially from Hayley Atwell. But the plot is infuriatingly formulaic. if Hayley Atwell didn't deliver such a powerhouse performance, I wouldn't have sympathized even a little bit with the protagonist. Everything seems like I've seen hundred times before, and everything is so predictable, except the ending which isn't great but at least unpredictable. Also, like some other Black Mirror episodes, Be Right Back presented and displayed its idea in a very simple and direct way that doesn't fit with such a top-quality series.(7.5/10)"
2,4, Tragedy and mimicry,8.0,"This review contains for the first episode of the second season of Black Mirror entitled ""Be Right Back"".After a tragic accident affects a couple, the surviving woman deals with grief. An experimental online service allows spouses and loved ones to communicate with the deceased. This is accomplished through the online service learning about the deceased person through chats and social media. Eventually Martha, the grieving widow commits more of Ash, the deceased, for the service's database.The first episode of the second season is incredibly strong. This episode encapsulates a lot of what makes Black Mirror great. The technology could happen in the near future and present this scenario. All of the actors in this episode do a phenomenal job. Haylee Atwell deserves praise for her great performance as Martha. The cross-section between Black Mirror's exploration of technology and human drama is what makes the show good.The theme of an imitation is well executed in this episode. From the beginning of the resurrected Ash communicating to Martha, the interaction mimicked reality with portions of it being off. This is only accelerated when more information is fed into the new Ash. Even when Ash regains a body, the interactions felt like an imitation. It was not real and was stuck in the past. Nothing new could develop from the relationship. This part of the story spoke to me and how it can be interpreted as a commentary on the current times.I highly recommend ""Be Right Back"". this episode marks a good start to the second season of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
2,4, Wow ! Creepy even for the mirror,7.0,"How far would you go to have your dearly departed back in your life?This episode actually plays along with a notion that seems visible at first , taking all of ones social media input , emails , texts etc and becoming a virtual self answering questions and talking to you as the one you know.Even when voice is included its something that could be a thing of the future, but then to put a naked none sex whatever into a bath of ice and hey presto the body is back balls n all with a none stop libido.A little spooky.A great episode spoiled by its ending , it just doesn't add up that the daughter keeps it secret and the none human version goes along and says nothing about being dad.Nah needs a different conclusion. But maybe my ( black mirror final showdown theory) will explain why"
2,4, Splits opinions. Everyone as one,7.0,"Ive seen sites where this comes out No1 in black mirror fave episodes. Thats the problem when you dont hold a ballot.Its just not my cup of tea, great idea in principle but could have been used much different. Some great one scenes however."
2,4, Liked it but not loved it.,9.0,"I think the problem was in the ending that was not clear. I don't think episode showed any black side of technology though the protagonist thought it was not as she expected but from my point of view it was the best technology can do, after all it is just technology not a human with perfect mind. So according to me in this episode only white side of technology was shown, though the protagonist always focussed on showing it bad, nothing else."
2,4, Simulcra and Simulation,8.0,"At what point do we step over the ""uncanny valley"" and into a simulation of something so real that, even for a brief moment, we convince ourself that it is real?In this episode, what technology takes away from us when we are living: our concentration and focus on the here and now, it attempts to reinstate when we are dead, all those lost opportunities and moments spent in the virtual world are returned, with interest.Only what comes back is merely a simulacrum, a reflection of what once was, and when the grief is over and one opens one's eyes again, one realises the shallowness of that before them and any previous feeling of intimacy and thankfulness is quickly soured into resentment and anger.IS there a difference between life itself and a simulation, thereof? And if a simulation were of sufficient complexity and sophistication, would it become indistinguishable from life itself?"
2,4, Very Emotional,10.0,"How far can technology take us? As far as, say, talking to a long-dead loved one on the phone, and even creating another physical version of him or her? Creepy, but the main character on this story did those. This episode is really unsettling...and also very emotional and powerful. The acting by the main character is simply fantastic. Best episode since the pilot."
2,4, first good one in two seasons,9.0,"I am watching them out of order. and thing ppl value at 8 shoks me. this one was actually high level all the way. strong script, acting, ark, originality. all there"
2,4, This Intimacy between Humans & Machines Can't be Possible ; yet a Magnificent Concept! 😍,9.0,"Sometimes Impossible things became possible with the help of advance Technology. But are they long lasting?
It's answer is briefly present here inside this Episode.This episode have something which we really wanna get, especially for our beloved family members! Whom we miss so much after their demise.
But after the fulfillment of our this impossible dream, it also gives us some dark side of this amazing concept.
Ha ha I know You're confusing after hearing so many Ifs'/Buts' here in my review, but trust me watch it for once you'll understand what I'm saying.I'm Going with 9 Out of 10 Stars for this Wonderful Concept. I mean Ohh wow, they just made it perfectly. You can't watch it with family members though because of some intimacy scenes between leading characters."
2,4, AI Frankenstein's monster,7.0,"Perfect execution and acting. The topic is relevant and is geting more attention even in Hollywood (Her, Ex Machina). The episode depicts many things: unhealthy mixing of online and offline life, devalvation of relationships, addiction to social networks, inability to let the past go or despicable marketing strategies.For me personally, the strongest point addressed by the episode is the ethicality of reviving a person from his/her ""internet footprint""."
2,5, Making the punishment fit the crime...,6.0,"A young woman awakens to find herself totally confused. She can't remember who she is and is amazed to see people chasing after her with weapons and they are trying to kill her. To make it all very surreal, there are LOTS of other people standing about with their smartphones videotaping the procedings. It seems that she's the prey in some strange game and the results are deadly. But what does it all mean??As usual, this episode of ""Black Mirror"" looks at modern technology and possible technology of the near future to propose how it might be abused. In this case, a woman is being horribly tormented and chased in something that is reminiscent of ""The Jerry Springer Show"" and a hunting show! Very thought provoking, I am a bit reticent to strongly recommend it because it becomes almost like torture porn watching the show. A bit too disturbing and vivid for many."
2,5, Cruel and Unusual Punishment,7.0,"A frightened young woman finds herself running for her life. It would seem that everyone has gone mad and do nothing to help her in her escape. She is shot at, beaten up, attacked, threatened with a kind of crucifixion. It would seem that she is the murderer of child and her hoped for escape is part of her punishment. I won't go into too many details other than to say that her punishment is wrong. Since she has no memory of her crime, to keep putting her through all this over and over makes no sense. I know the idea is to make her feel what the child felt, but her memory has been scrubbed. This is a cheap trick that shows like the Outer Limits already did a couple times."
2,5, Punishment online,8.0,"Victoria Skillane (Lenora Crichlow) awakes dazed and confused on a chair in front of a television with a weird sign, pills spilled on the floor and bandage around her wrists. She walks around the house with amnesia and glimpses of a girl. She sees a picture of her, a man and the girl on a fireplace and she concludes she might be her daughter. She leaves the house and sees people watching and filming her passively. Out of the blue, a man with a rifle hunts her down and she runs under the view of the inhabitants. She meets a young woman called Jem (Tuppence Middleton) that explains to her that most of the population is controlled by a signal from the White Bear transmitted that transforms them into voyeurs. They run to a convenience store in a gas station and the hunter shots and kills Jem's friend Damien (Ian Bonar). They run to escape and a man called Baxter (Michael Smiley) stops a van and saves them from hunters. But the guy is a sadistic hunter but they succeed to flee. Jem explains that she intends to burn the White Bear to the ground and they drive to the facility. When they reach the place, Victoria learns secrets about her and the place where nothing is what seems to be.""White Bear"" is a film with a cruel and dark story of punishment online with a surprising plot point in the end. The truth about Victoria is absolutely unexpected. The story has criticism to the present lifestyle, with people not interacting with the others and passively watching the world through the screens. Further the population maybe tired of the present injustices in the legal system has created the perfect punishment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not available."
2,5," Twisted, clever, one of the best.",9.0,"White Bear is another superb episode of Black Mirror, definitely one of the best of the early seasons. Lenora Crichlow is terrific as the main character, and her bizarre scenario is terrifically exciting and enthralling. The twist is huge, and delivered in such a way, that you lose all empathy for the 'victim.' it's a very visual episode, it looks incrediy stylish, the story is such, that it stays with you, it certainly gets you wondering.One of the best. 9/10"
2,5," ""Throw her back to where she came from.""",8.0,"The guy who really deserved the White Bear Justice Park treatment was Victoria Skillane's (Lenora Crichlow) boyfriend, but he was already dead due to the crime the couple perpetrated. This is an episode that really keeps you guessing until the major reveal near the end with the studio audience and the 'actors' taking their bows. There will be those viewers who are repulsed by the story's repetitive punishment for the kidnapping crime, while others will sense a fitting justification for keeping Victoria on an endless treadmill. I'm kind of torn on this one, but I have to admit the execution was excellently done. Lenora Crichlow was superb in her role as the brain addled Victoria and the relentless pace of the chase to capture her doesn't let up for much of a breather. The tease with the masks and costumes make the ones giving chase appear to be the bad guys, but when that's turned on it's head, the result is as surprising to the viewer as it is to Ms. Skillane. Watching 'Black Mirror' in order, this one came across as the most surreal so far, if not the most thought provoking. It would seem to be a hard one to top."
2,5, Very good... Just not as great as I wish it was,8.0,"This has its share of intense beats, and the climax pays off. But I didn't gravitate to it like other parts of series 1, 2 and 3. The big twist (and it's one that is major) helps to give everything that happens more sense, and maybe I woukd find more a second go around. I just question so many resources being used against one person, regardless of the severity of the crime. Maybe if there was a follow up episode where they show the political debate about using tax dollars for such a thing as a ""Criminal Park"". So in other words it is effective but it only works with the reveal (maybe as just a nightmare it would be a real wallop). Or, on top of this, I can't help but think back to seeing this done with far tighter and harrowing execution inn Watkins's Punishment Park in the early 70s - the concept here isn't far off, only no cell phones and it was more up front with the concept. I do like that the 'host' is one of those ""oh, THAT Ben Wheatley character actor!"
2,5, Twist in the tale,8.0,"I never saw the twist in the tale of this fine episode of Black MIrror. Much has been written about this seminal episode from the mind of Charlie Brooker. I'm especially impressed by the English gloomy skies, which add more than a touch of realism to this harrowing episode where we are desperate to make sense of the horror. What is the white bear? We soon find out."
2,5, Intolerable cruelty.,7.0,"The second series of 'Black Mirror (2011-)' continues with 'White Bear', which is perhaps the most 'twist-reliant' episode so far. In fact, it's the only episode of the first two seasons to pivot entirely on a single, central reveal. That's not to say it's bad, though. The plot point in question does reshape the rest of the piece, while also opening a discussion around several interesting themes. When is a punishment considered a crime? Can you be held responsible for something you have no recollection of? How far is too far? These questions are incredibly intriguing and the picture does an excellent job of posing them without even really attempting to answer them. It's thematically compelling and often uncomfortable, its devilishly dark and near nihilistic outlook never once relenting. The bulk of the movie is taken up by a more straightforward survival story, though. It's chock full of mysteries and doesn't really come into itself until its final third. It's always enjoyable, though. It may not be the best 'Black Mirror (2011-)', but it's still a solid piece of science-fiction. 7/10"
2,5, 9,9.0,"That's definitely very brutal punishment at first I though that this episode is going to be very basic and simple but the ending surprised me. Very nice, almost perfect."
2,5, Satire of hypocrisy,8.0,"A young woman wakes up from unconsciousness with complete amnesia. Not knowing who she is or where she is, she begins to wander around and it becomes increasingly clear to her that something is seriously wrong. All the people she encounters stare at her in complete silence and record her with mobile phones, keeping a safe distance at all times. And then masked lunatics begin to appear, trying in every way to get to her, completely ignoring the silent observers.Almost everything I want to comment on this episode would spoil it to those who have not seen it yet. The series has gone a step further and sci-fi drama, that characterized the previous episodes, here is brought to the brink of horror. A mysterious story, good acting and even better directing build a creepy and tense atmosphere, which culminates in a completely unexpected twist. All sorts of theories went through my head, but at no point was I even close to grasping what it was all about. Original and very effective.8/10."
2,5, What is justice?,7.0,"As most other episodes of Black Mirror, this one raised difficult questions through uncomfortable viewing. That is why I would not feel honest to write that I ""liked"" it - as in ""it was fun, I'd like to watch it again"".I would not want to watch this again, but for sure it made me think about punishment that fits the crime. Nowadays, lots of people feel that criminals literally get away with murder and that punishment for heinous crimes is too light.To which extent particularly cruel crimes should be punished? The extent showed in this episode seems OK, up to the point of repetition. How many times is the criminal supposed to go through the same torture? Is ten years of suffering enough to pay for a week of criminal activity? And who establishes how long the punishment must last?Uncomfortable food for thought."
2,5, Cruel and unusual punishment,8.0,Another episode that highlights a flaw about humanity that has always existed. We must be entertained.
2,5, This episode doesn't hang about!,9.0,"Black Mirror episodes often set a scene and take some time to lure you in and immerse you in the characters before frying your brain with a clever twist or a thought-provoking idea!White Bear is straight in there, right from the off it's a hard hitting, fast ride, littered with tension, mystery and excitment.There's a powerful message in this one and it's executed brilliantly come the reveal at the end!Quality 9/10"
2,5," Only Torture Drama, No Si Fi nor Thriller",2.0,"I was expecting it should be a good science fiction with thriller but lastly found only torture drama, which made me very irritated at last 10 minutes. To say truly I could not see such torture again and again. What to say writer & director ? Torture is never enjoyable at all. Ratings 10,9 or 8 are not understandable to me. A request to writer and director not to show such horrifying episodes.In my personal opinion story is going well till first half and then writer did not understand what is proceed further, so he turned story to an awful way, which is totally different from original story and would be unbelievable. Otherwise story may be meaningful at the end."
2,5, Chilling!,8.0,"This episode of Black Mirror, entitled WHITE BEAR, confounds me. I circled around wondering where and how to rank it in the series. The only thing I know for certain is that Lenora Crichlow (as the episode protagonist Victoria Skillane) delivers arguably the greatest performance of the entire series, a completely immersive, lived-in piece of acting. How in the hell did this woman not win an award for this emotionally powerful masterpiece of acting? Her acting alone makes the episode worth watching.Now to the content of the episode. I was a little bit annoyed by all the people running around with their cell phones, which kind of took me out of the experience at times. Also, I didn't much care for the supporting characters. I was so transfixed by Skillane's character, everyone and everything else felt second fiddle. And by the end of it all, I still didn't very much care about any character's involvement other than Skillane, although perhaps that was the intent. The dank, chilly setting was fitting for the downbeat nature of the episode and the ending was definitely shocking, but it was really Crichlow's fantastic acting that carried it all the way. The ending is very shocking, but the getting there can be annoying at times. But it's definitely one of the more interesting Black Mirror endings."
2,5, GIGANTIC hammer cracking smallish nut,7.0,"Make no mistake, this episode watched as it goes can readily seem a candidate for the scariest and most disturbing thing shown on British TV in recent times. It's quite graphic and very disorientating, and psychologically disturbing.And then we get the punchline, and kind of track back to what we've been seeing; and it's hard not to see what has gone before as somehow gratuitous and manipulative.Hyperbole at least has been deployed big-timeThat said, the core idea of people's punishment becoming a form of mass entertainment is not so far off the mark (from history too, of course). And likewise the idea that we might want to utterly humiliate, abuse and remove all rights from those found guilty of heinous crimes. This is ironic given the fact that lead character Victoria (an effective Leonora Crichlow) is someone we are conditioned to sympathise with when her plight unfolds through the episode - as we think it is doing in some dystopian fashion; only to find at a given moment that we had NO INSIGHT INTO THE REALITY WHATSOEVER.This is an original and shocking approach, but the episode's volte-face is so wrong-footing that we don't fully adjust to the new reality in the time allowed for that, and so we actually get a bit less from the work than we might.The point being made is strong and interesting anyway, but we are entitled to ask if the overall take of the episode is actually condemnatory enough..."
2,5, Over punishment,8.0,"This review contains spoilers for the second episode of the second season of Black Mirror entitled ""White Bear"".The episode opens with a woman waking from amnesia. In the house, a strange symbol is shown on the television screens. After exiting the house, she finds people recording her and offering no assistance. The episode follows this episode as she tries to survive the apocalyptic situation.This episode contains a twist that does the earlier runtime make more sense. The plot is absolutely engrossing from the beginning to the end, the plot follows the woman as she tries to survive. The world is fun to learn about as the entire situation seemed impossible.The movie does episode does have a great pace and the twist of realizing the theme park is awesome. This was where the commentary on society goes into full swing like other episodes of Black Mirror. It is a great commentary for how the media desensitizes the public's behaviors. It is not far-fetched to believe that the the public in today's world could accept the society in ""White Bear"".I highly recommend the second episode of the second season of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
2,5, make no sense,2.0,"another reviewer had it right that there's too much going on in this episode, to the point that, sticking with one theme makes it a painfully blunt, semi-clever take on the ""bystander effect"". Sticking with the other (as it eventually did) makes it not make sense.the idea of wiping a criminal's memory and then punishing their new ""personality"" is a subject handled much better in a show like Babylon 5 with Brad Douriff playing a priest traumatized by nightmares of murder, to which it's revealed he used to be a serial killer who was basically ""repurposed"" as a useful member of society.here, the criminal's memory is wiped, then they're punished with an elaborate nonsensical scenario that has absolutely nothing to do with the nature of their crime, then at the very end everything is revealed to them and they're given a ""walk of shame"" moment while basically completely oblivious as to what the hell just happened.personally the concept of ""punishing"" a criminal by wiping their memory and then punishing them is immoral and nonsensical, as by wiping their memory you've essentially created a whole new person, and you're now tormenting that person for the crimes of someone else. Even leaving that aside, the ""punishment"" makes no sense relative to the crime and by repeatedly wiping their memory and doing it all over again it completely defeats the purpose.but all of that is resolved in the mid-credits sequence of clips which show this is all basically an amusement park designed to make money off people paying to watch someone suffer in a post-apocalyptic hellscape then yell at them afterwards, adding a third, poorly executed moral theme about commercializing suffering or something that could've been done better"
2,5, OMG should i feel sorry or not ?,10.0,"Test your humanity
The poor girl , wakes , frightened, unsure and disoriented. Asking for help , being chased by a crazy man with a shot gun whilst passer bys take photos and film on phones. As the craziest of situations continues her life is put at risk multiple times when all of a sudden.Crack!Black Mirror of course and one of the most head thumping twists as you now thinking does she deserve it, how bad are we for thinking this way.Why do you do this Brooker?"
2,5, Unalloyed irony and hypocrisy,8.0,"Funny how these two words don't seem to come up, at least in the comments and reviews I have read, yet they're what this episode is all about. Irony and hypocrisy.Without wanting to say too much, although I've flagged this comment as containing a spoiler (first time I've used this function), the denouement makes clear that the many dozens--hundreds even! --of people involved in this project, are guilty of quite cruel hypocrisy--they are engaging in precisely the behavior that they claim to be helping to punish--and are part of a spectacle that is as ironic as can be imagined.For this reason I've rated this episode fairly highly, although I don't believe the interests of verisimilitude have been served. I don't believe--and certainly don't want to believe-that any significant number of people could be so heartless, so utterly devoid of human empathy."
2,5, Oh. My. God,10.0,"That twist at the end was something..Sure I understand the complaint that this episode is just a woman screaming and running around for 40 minutes but it's the point. The episode put us in the shoes of Victoria, confused and scared of what is happening and in the end, one of the best plot twists ever happens."
2,5, Fatally Flawed,2.0,"Whoever wrote the script for this is an idiot. Okay, so the woman videoed her fiance killing a child. Yup, that is completely awful. However, when you wipe out someone's entire memory, you have changed the person. She no longer remembers the crime and is not any longer the person who did it.This episode takes a completely new person and subjects them to torture over and over again. It's not punishment because she has no knowledge of her crime. When a person cannot understand why they are being punished, the punishment is pointless. And no, showing her the video at the end does not solve this problem. It makes it worse. Because regardless, it is a different person.Beyond stupid and easily the worst Black Mirror."
2,5, Plot Twisted Cleverly and This generations Intentions Revealed!,8.0,"If you focus on the episode it's just gave us a powerful message, like how we all are busy in keep shooting of someone's misery with our Mobile phone rather then helping him/her . In fact, in some cases suppose an accident happened nearby, lots of people will be gather together and will busy in shooting videos and pics, but only few people will be there to call the Ambulance.
It's just an example don't take it seriously.Black Mirror series is somehow really interesting which I'm watching right now. May be it's just because it's openly shows us today's generations silly inhumane things due to rapid growth in Technology field or development in eye-catching lifestyles.Anyways! This episode is brilliantly written and directed as well. The leading characters also justified their own roles in this whole 42minutes episode. A Mind-Blowing Experience with a cleverly plot twist ending.I am going with 8 out of 10 Stars for this amazing episode, you can watch this particular episode with your family as well, because it doesn't contain any kind of vulgarity, but some mild torture scenes were there, but it's manageable."
2,6, Sadly....I don't think we're very far from this at all.,9.0,"""Black Mirror"" is a British series that consisted of two episodes...until Netflix got involved and commissioned more episodes. This episode is one of the original ones.Waldo is an animated television character who is done LIVE using modern motion-capture technology. He is voiced by an out of work comedian, so you know the character is quick-witted. But he's also crude, offensive and annoying...yet the public seems to love Waldo and his offensive antics...so much that they decide to unleash him on a local election for Parliament. He pretty much makes a mockery of the election and despite how offensive and awful Waldo is the public love him. At this point...Waldo's voice starts to worry where all this is headed.This is a very prescient episode of ""Black Mirror"". I think it gauges the public and their sheep mentality quite accurately...especially in light of some of our recent elections. I don't want to make this a political rant...just see this clever and very insightful show."
2,6, Is This the Future,6.0,"Another dystopian venture. In this one, a cartoon bear named Waldo confronts the establishment politicians with obscene and acerbic comments. The guy who voices him is a two-bit comedian who simply howls insults, but catches on. There are times when the voters get a feeling of being disenfranchised and go for the lowest common denominator. We are currently in a period of populism, which usually mean the dumb, uninformed people are handed power. People who have no knowledge of infrastructure, human rights, or basic decency. The scariest thing is that these things have gone global. This episode also implies that there are forces who know how to manipulate all this craziness to destroy people who do good. I guess, there's so much cynicism here that the whole thing turned me off. Just too simplistic to work. But still we need to beware."
2,6, Searching for the New in Politics,7.0,"The comedian Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby) has created the blue cartoon bear Waldo and provides voice and movements to the character. Waldo is the host of a night show where he interviews politicians to humiliate them. When the conservative politician Liam Monroe (Tobias Menzies), who is the leader in the researches, is irritated by Waldo during a show, his producer Tamsin (Christina Chong) and the television owner Jack Napier (Jason Flemyng) decide to follow Monroe along his campaign to disturb him against Jamie's will. Waldo becomes popular and people decides to vote him to protest against politician. Meanwhile Jamie has one night stand with the Labour Party candidate Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie) and they fall in love with each other. However Gwendolyn is advised by the party adviser to keep distance from Jamie during the campaign since he might use inside information in his show. During a debate, Monroe uses the information he has about Jamie and offends him. Jamie has an anger outburst and attacks Monroe and Gwendolyn. What will be the consequences in the upcoming election?""The Waldo Moment"" is a ""Black Mirror"" show with a great idea – the search for the new in politics. A clown was recently elected congressman in Brazil with the largest number of votes in a clear demonstration of dissatisfaction of the Brazilian voters with the politicians. Waldo would be a similar case in the plot. However, director Bryn Higgins shows heavy hand and what could have been a great satire becomes a deep drama. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
2,6, Vote Waldo!,7.0,"Of all the episodes of Black Mirror that I've seen, this one seems the least far fetched, when you look at the state of The UK right now politically, this doesn't seem too far off, people are so detached politically right now, that I can believe in this.It doesn't have the depth of other episodes, when you consider that this followed White Bear in particular, it does lack any sort of shock factor, or any real emotional depth.The moment where Jamie attacks the MPs is great, he clearly doesn't handle rejection well.Politics in 2018, I could vote for a blue bear.As a political geek I enjoyed this one, and love its relevance, but I get that the appeal to this one is more limited. Daniel Rigby and Tobias Menzies are both terrific.Better then it's perceived. 7/10"
2,6," ""I'm the vote of a blue bear.""",5.0,"Episodes like this lose me when they get over the top obscene and vulgar like this one did. You don't have to be a prude to get turned off, but when it's relentless and unbalanced by an effective, opposing point of view, then I don't see any value in maintaining my interest. One can see however how things are generally trending this way in the life of our political discourse. Pretty soon, the candidates themselves will be throwing the 'F' word around and at each other during a prime time debate. To his credit, Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby), the voice of Waldo, wanted none of it when his producers put him in the running for an election to Parliament. Waldo's second place finish under the guidance of Jack (Jason Flemyng) seemed like a pretty good wake up call to a society that places more emphasis on crude celebrity than credible ideas on how to improve society."
2,6," Terrific, ruthless satire",10.0,"The Waldo Moment, one if the high points of the early Black Mirror series, captures what happens when animated and/or satirical things come up in popular life, including politics, especially in the UK (remember that nominee for PM who was literally like a black helmeted knight out of Monty Python, Lord whoever). We love cartoons because of the abstraction of it, that they can represent so much that we don't face when it is a regular flesh and blood person in front of us. Think of South Park and Family Guy, or as a human example Stephen Colbert back when he was Colbert of the Report. The Waldo Moment captures all of the mania that comes with a figure, a joke, a walking talking prank, getting the attention of a public who can be so easily galvanized. One may see Jason Flemyng as the cynical villain - a character out of Chayefsky's Network (this reminded me of that too). It might not have the twists of other Black Mirror parts, and if I have any real mark against it I almost wish it was longer than its usual 40 minute show length. But it tells its story with excellent conviction, and recent times have beared out (no pun intended.. Ok a little) what it is saying. It gets in and gets out and does even better what the first episode of this series tried to do with the PM and sex with a pig, which was a solid concept done somewhat typically."
2,6," Populist and populism, kind of foreshadowed...",8.0,"Charlie Booker has a knack for foreseeing trends, and The Waldo Moment seemed to presage the populist movements around the world...Greece, The Philippines, UK (Brexit) and of course the USA in particular the 2016 presidential election. It seems Charlie also foresaw accusations about a now former Prime Minister and student antics with a pig.Waldo is quite crude yet he gets much of the population to adore him. But Waldo is part of something bigger, a worldwide scheme that is more than a political campaign.One thing I didn't really get was that no-one dared to go behind the screen and wring their hands around the man behind Waldo!! Why not?"
2,6, Apolitical is political.,7.0,"'The Waldo Moment (2013)' seems to be one of the more polarising episodes of 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. Perhaps it released ahead of its time or perhaps it isn't overtly sci-fi enough. Personally, I think it fits in just fine with its peers. It has only gotten more relevant since its release, in a myriad of nearly impossible to predict ways. Once again, Brooker creates a bleak, thematically rich story that keeps its focus firmly on character. Though they aren't the most well-rounded in the show, the central figures of this story all feel like real people. Possibly the piece's best and most frightening aspect is the way in which its in-universe public react to the events they're experiencing. It hits close to home and has plenty to say. The same can be said of the entire affair. It's a solid, entertaining slice of low-key science-fiction. Honestly, I don't understand some of the apparent hesitation towards it; it's as much 'Black Mirror' as any other episode is. 7/10"
2,6, 5,5.0,"So the producers did great job for whole 35minutes with interesting plot of this episode and they've decided they're doing too well and make the ending miserable disappointment, really sad."
2,6, The weakest link,5.0,"Jamie is a mediocre comedian who lends his voice to the blue animated bear Waldo. Waldo is in the style of the ""South Park"" series, only at a much lower and more primitive level. During the election, the producers use Waldo to ridicule the candidates. The unexpectedly good reaction of the public leads them to put Waldo in the race. But Jamie is not material for a politician and snaps under pressure. In an attempt to destroy the campaign, he destroys his private life, while politics goes on, as if nothing had happened.The idea is good, especially because it is not far from reality, but the realization is poor, or perhaps, a better word is lazy. Political satire is lukewarm, and human drama does not arouse any emotions, both because of the weak script and because of the unimpressive acting.5/10."
2,6," This one appealled to me, although my wife found Waldo annoying lol!",9.0,"The Waldo Moment is a brilliant satirical look at the state of modern politics.This one isn't deep or even that clever, so far as Black Mirror episodes go. But it is very funny and actually quite tragic that it feels so true to life.The Politics, the society, and the media are all very accurately portrayed. And in the real world we all have to admit that Waldo would get votes, he may even win if he really did run for office!9/10 for it's sheer simplicity"
2,6," Not without some merit, but the series is losing its way here, by going too far...",5.0,"While the postscript is more crucial than the episode here (so don't press the stop button too soon!), a crude, foul-mouthed blue-coloured cartoon bear destructive of and tending to trivilalise political debate only has so much mileage in it, one would feel. Even though people might indeed cheer on such pricking of the pompous political bubble (as they did with ""Spitting Image"" in the 80s), it was - as the Conservative candidate says here, that oh-so-pompous and ostensibly-irrelevant party-political system ""that built the roads"" (this is actually the most worthwhile comment in the episode, even though it was most likely not meant to be!)And of course the British state also built hospitals and dispensed life-saving drugs and carried out operations too. And kept the peace and allowed many people who want to to make progress in their lives.So could this disrespectful blue character called Waldo really be used to promote dissent, encourage violence and revolt and give rise to a police state? Is today's image online and in other forms really so indestructable once created? Would attempts by states to eradicate the phenomenon only encourage its popularity, and drive it underground? Do (most) people really want to abandon conventional politics and replace it with nihilism?These are worthwhile questions, conceivably, but the episode only hints at them, deciding to stay mostly with the first emergence of the Waldo phenomenon; and for this viewer at least, the behaviour of the bear - with or without his original handler (played by Daniel Rigby) - actually makes a slightly slimy Conservative candidate look sensible, sympathetic and likeable (and he did win the election anyway); while encouraging fellow feeling for a rather hopeless female Labour Party candidate who always knew she had no chance of winning (that's actors Tobias Menzies and Chloe Pirrie, if anybody's especially bothered).While ""Black Mirror"" can be quite tremendously clever and thought-provoking, here - one believes - it is taking a vaguely sensible/conceivable premise and stretching it well beyond its limits. And the targeting is off, too, as the main condemnation here is not against a failed/failing conventional political system, but against people who can readily be encouraged into hooligan behaviour.So not much new there, really?Interestingly, Waldo's ultimate owner (played by Jason Flemyng) here does - in one sentence of dialogue - raise issues about sidestepping parliaments by going straight to the people online ... of a kind therefore very familiar to those who recall the 2017 Emma Watson/Tom Hanks vehicle ""The Circle"". While the latter film was weak by any standards, it considered the issue referred to quite effectively (at moments at least), while ""The Waldo Moment"" is entirely tangential to this genuine threat that DOES exist for democracy; preferring instead to go with a cartoon character crudely obsessed with its own phallus.Somehow we've slightly missed the target, haven't we?"
2,6, Anti-politics,6.0,"This review contains spoilers for the third episode of the second season of Black Mirror entitled ""The Waldo Moment.""The episode opens with the political season ramping up in the United Kingdom. Waldo, a cartoon bear controlled by Jamie Salter, interviews politicians and authority figures in a comedic way. Waldo is incredibly popular among the British public. During a brainstorming session, the people working with Waldo suggest entering the political race.The episode has a big links to political systems across the world. This episode is a good commentary on how a political system can fail a large portion of a population. Although this is one of the weaker episodes in the second season, the episode had as much if not more to say in its plot and themes. The Waldo Moment presented a theory that the public could be motivated to choose a candidate that stands for nothing. This choice can be reflected by elections recently where many voters feel alienated and disenfranchised by the choices that are presented to them. Waldo is simply a conglomeration of these voters.I would recommend ""The Waldo Moment"".Grade: B"
2,6, Who painted my mirror ?,7.0,"This is a funny , tragic and interesting tale of a guy whos career as tumbled to rock bottom. However he has one saving grace a cartoon based character he lends his voice too. However now that looks to be in danger he needs a new idea and quick.Main flaw , its nkt black mirror imho however i have a feeling that when the last black is cast every episode will marry up so maybe im missing somethingA wobbly 6"
2,6, Like an extended newswipe clip ( Charlie Brooker UK show ),7.0,"I think Charlie got his shows confused , although the plot significantly points out how you can end up with a President Trump this is in the main a comedy, a look at British politics, and the rise of populism.Its a good one of show but not very black mirror."
2,6, Not as great as the others,7.0,"This is a good episode, but not as fantastic as the others. It's the weakest episode by far. The story is about a failed comedian who voices a comedic cartoon named Waldo. It is a political satire. The acting is great but the story lacks something."
2,6, Spoilers of the Future Politics!,7.0,"I don't know why this episode is rated so much low! Perhaps it was released back in 2013 so that people might not understood it's premises!
But when we see today's world of politics, we might get a question in our mind.
Is it a Spoiler of our future politics?Anyways! A great episode it was and the leading character ""WALDO"" is totally Badass. Ha ha the way he talks, the instant way he make jokes of MPs are really cool. Overall it was not that Hi-Tech futuristic technology concept type episode, like all other previous episodes of Black Mirror, but I personally Loved it.And that's why gonna rate it for 7 out of 10 Stars. This episode contains some abusive words and a sexually explicit scene so avoid watching with family!"
2,6, Extrapolation of current politics,7.0,"Weaker (but not weak) episode. The the episode further develops the topics featured in National Anthem and thanks to other aspects The Waldo Moment will be relevant for a long time. Voter apathy, ad hominem attacks, lies, rigidity, idleness and populism are, unfortunately, parts of modern politics. The episode exagerates most of it, but the similarity to real world is still there."
2,6, Captures election back stage manipulation perfectly.,8.0,"This episode was dragging along a bit, only holding my partial interest - until the meeting with a shady US representative. What followed was a very clever and thought provoking 5 minute scene carried solely by extremely well written dialogue.I thought the whole episode was meant to pivot around this scene. It did for me and I increased the stars accordingly.A few stories have been a little, (or a lot), cringe-worthy with a slightly alien, (very British), approach to the overseas viewer. Overall I keep watching and looking for the gems."
2,6, I see what this episode for...,6.0,"I see political apathy and Waldo.... this episode spend too much time with Jamie. I want to see after Jamie resigned. But Waldo was very funny and slow tempo of the episode made me feel like I was one of the public in the episode, which was great."
2,6," Great, underrated episode",10.0,"I don't know if this episode really deserves a 10 rating, but it was a fantastic episode, in a highly inventive series. Definitely not the weakest in the series: that one would be Nosedive. (Even that episode was really good, but the first 40 minutes were pure torture to get through.)This episode deserves a much higher rating, overall. Ignore the negative reviews and judge for yourself."
2,6, Ehh,5.0,"Definitely a low point in the show as a whole. Although it was semi prophetic of society, it just didn't strike me as intense and unnerving as most other episodes. I think the stakes were just too low.
It was also the only episode I can remember where I didn't actually feel bad for one or more of the characters by the end. I'm not sure if Jamie just wasn't very sympathetic or if I felt he basically brought the hardships at the end on himself. Either way, I just didn't really care what happened to him. 5/10"
2,6," Episode has potential, but ultimately falls flat",6.0,"I ultimately appreciate the message the writers convey here about the intersection of politics, pop culture, comedy, and technology. However, everything about the Waldo character falls flat. Waldo is unpleasant to listen to and look at. It doesn't help that the writing for the Waldo character is terrible, he's neither funny nor insightful in any way. The actor voicing him does a terrible job at it, the timbre is unpleasant and he doesn't sound like any kind of professional voice actor. He sounds like if you asked any rando on the street to immediately come up with some kind of fake voice.I suppose the lack of depth to Waldo's insights was partially intentional, a statement on the influence of shallow comedy on real politics. Either way nothing about the Waldo character works, to me, hiring an actual professional voice actor could have gone a long way here."
2,7, One of the best.,10.0,"SPOILER: The British sci-fi anthology series consists of various tales about how technology will possibly create a more hellish world in the near future...and none of the episodes I have seen so far are as hellish a future as this one.The story is set in a room with two men. One is talkative and a bit jovial and the other, apparently, has been mostly silent the last five years. What follows are two stories by the more talkative man as he recounts how he abused technology. And, these stories, in turn, help the quiet man to finally start talking and he tells a very sad story about losing his wife/girlfriend (not sure which)...and she was pregnant! He desperately wants to see her and work things out...as well as see his child. But thanks to modern tech, he literally CAN'T see either as unfriending takes on a strange and sad finality.I really don't want to say too much about this one...it's not an easy episode to explain AND it would give away too much. Suffice to say it's exquisitely written, very moving as well as scary to imagine such an awful and hellish future...all perhaps possible one day thanks to technology. See this one!!"
2,7, A Well Constructed Nightmare,8.0,"These episodes are about things that frighten us more than any threat physical or otherwise. The invite us into a world where we are alone and hopeless. We always think about eternity in some pit of hell, with devils and pitchforks. This is about the impossibility of redemption. There are forces at work that punish without mercy and leave people to face eternity alone. No human contact. No dignity. So what can they do. This one is about two men in an old house in the middle of nowhere, telling stories about why they have been imprisoned. These are horrible tales of murder and ugliness. One man is a master salesman who works the technology of the time to gain his prurient ends. The second a sad, unstable jerk who crosses his wife and is doomed to not see his child. No one really looks at her except we know that she faced some really sad times. These are powerful and almost sick."
2,7," The Darkest, Creepiest and Best ""Black Mirror""",9.0,"Joe Potter (Rafe Spall) wakes up on the Christmas Day and finds his talkative co-worker Matt Trent (Jon Hamm) preparing the Christmas dinner. They have been working together for five years in a remote outpost in the middle of nowhere in the snow. Joe does not like to talk, but Matt decides to tell his story. Matt was helping the shy Harry (Rasmus Hardiker) to seduce the beautiful Jennifer (Natalia Tena) in a party using the ""Z-Eye"" implanted in his eyes in an illegal procedure. Harry succeeds and they go to Jennifer's apartment but things go awry and they die. Matt delete the evidences of his participation but his wife blocks him and they become invisible and inaudible to each other. Then Matt explains that he really worked with a chip called Cookie, capable to make a digital copy of the user. Then he forced the copy to serve the real user through torture manipulating time to break any resistance from the copy. Joe decides to tell why he came to the outpost and he explains that he lived with Beth (Janet Montgomery). One night, they have dinner with their friends Tim (Dan Li) and Gita (Zahra Ahmadi) and Beth is feeling tired and absent. She goes to bed and Joe cleans the kitchen. However, he accidentally drops the garbage on the floor and he sees a positive pregnancy test. He questions Beth and she tells that she will abort the baby. They have an argument and Beth blocks and leaves Joe. One day, he accidentally finds her silhouette on the street and he discovers that she is raising her child with her father. However he is incapable to see neither Beth nor the child since he is still blocked. But when Beth dies in a train accident, Joe goes to her father's house to see his child and he has a surprise. But where the outpost is located? ""White Christmas"" is the darkest, creepiest and also the best episode of ""Black Mirror"". The story is original despite the predictable conclusion. The plot is very disturbing and cruel and the idea of the Cookie is scary. Joe Potter is a totally unlucky guy: has an unfaithful girlfriend; a disloyal friend; a false co-worker; a daughter that is not of his own; he accidentally commits the murders; and he will be punished for eternity along Christmas. Poor man! My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): Not available"
2,7, Blissfully dark viewing. Darker then the toast.,10.0,"I think the first time round I watched it I didn't fully absorb into it, subsequently I would now class it as one of the very best. It's is definitely one of the darkest, bleakest and down right sadistic episodes, and for a show like Black Mirror that's really saying something. I've tried to think up one narrative that links each episode of Black Mirror, and it's tough, the closest I've gotten is that mankind will always use technology to take advantage of others, be it monetary, political or for love. We get three stories in this episode and that rule could definitely apply in each case. I love the idea of three stories combining to make one, it's a technique that's not often used, but when it does it's hugely satisfying, each story links with each other, elements would also reappear in later stories, such as Arkangel.Lots of questions come out of it, did Potter get rough justice, or was he the victim, was Matt a good or a bad guy? Is under cooked toast actually edible? You could debate and argue it for hours. John Hamm and Rafe Spall were excellent, two very strong performances. Visually dazzling as always.The top of many people's Christmas watch list I shouldn't wonder."
2,7," ""There's no such thing as real people.""",10.0,"I was compelled to watch this episode of 'Black Mirror' a second time. There seems to be no doubt that the series has a fascination with dealing severe retribution and justice for crimes against humanity. 'White Bear' was a good story, but this one was brilliant in it's execution, weaving it's way through three interconnecting stories with Smartelligence agent Matthew (Jon Hamm) guiding us along. Each of those individual stories stand well on their own, but the way things are brought around to their ultimate conclusion is shocking in it's cycle of unending repetition. Watching the series in order, this one is so far the best that 'Black Mirror' has to offer, but I wouldn't be surprised if writer Charlie Brooker tops even himself in a later episode. The question is, where else can you go from here?"
2,7," ""I'm dreaming of a black mirror.""",10.0,"Despite having heard of it for years,I've never seen a episode of Black Mirror. Discovering online about a X-Mas special from the show,I looked into the mirror for the first time.View on the episode:The first American protagonist in the run of the series, Jon Hamm gives a excellent performance as Matt,with Hamm playing on his sharp suit image, via Matt presenting a front image of being casually likeable and easy to approach,which acts as a mask to his hideous psychopathic actions.Sharing a birthday with Hamm (March 10th) Rafe Spall gives a subtle turn as Potter, whose jolly festive image Spall untangles to revealing the doom-laden misery which has left him lonely this Christmas.For the last episode made for Channel 4, the screenplay by Charlie Brooker ends this era of the series on a high, with the three separate stories recording cyber-stalking, AI increasingly infringing on society, and ""blocking"" on social media, all tied with a bow that packages them as Sci-Fi anthology morality tales.Gradually bringing to light the surroundings they are in the more the duo reveal about themselves in the tales, Brooker unwraps the wrap-around story with a deliciously macabre twist ending leaving Matt and Potter in a state where they will be wishing it is Christmas everyday."
2,7, Christmas will never be the same again,9.0,"A compelling Christmas addition to Black Mirror, with this episode broadcast in 2014. I'm now catching up on the earlier episodes of Black Mirror.Anyway, Jon Hamm guides viewers through this Christmas special, with Rafe Spall wrapping up the episode with his story. Two Spanish actresses, Oona Chaplin and Natalia Tena (who was in About a Boy) appear, along with Janet Montgomery, Brian Li and Leanne Li.Production values were impressive, and you could feel the English snow on screen!I now have to subscribe to Netflix to catch up on seasons 3, 4 and 5, and also Bandersnatch."
2,7," Slow at times and kind of obvious after a while, but still damn good!",8.0,"Funny enough, at the end of the show the voice of the TV announcer advertised the next show: the conviction of a pedophile. It was completely unintentional and really ironic.John Hamm again perfectly plays the charismatic, but self serving ass. Him and another guy are isolated somewhere during Christmas so they begin telling their stories and how they arrived there. Slowly, but surely, the main thread of the Black Mirror show is revealed, showing us how technology can be misused by people who don't even comprehend the consequences. The finale is truly maddening, so to speak.I loved the first season of Black Mirror, but I was kind of disappointed with the second. This Christmas special is top notch and is certainly worth a watch. It was slightly too long and some of the hints were really obvious, as well as some issues being over dramatized to the loss of consistency. However it did reach its point rather well."
2,7, The horror of Christmas music.,8.0,"'White Christmas (2014)' caps off the second series of 'Black Mirror (2011-)' in style; it's easily the best episode of that season. It's also unusual because it's, essentially, an extended Christmas special. The thing is centred around two men telling tales as they eat their roast dinner, with the stories getting progressively more intense as they go on. Each segment is interesting in and of itself, but each one is ultimately integral to the overall story. The scenes with Hamm and Spall aren't just framing devices, even if they do serve that function. The affair is consistently character-driven and often surprising. Its brilliant, typically understated performances convey each beat perfectly. The themes it explores are intriguing and, as usual, deeply tragic; Brooker really knows how to twist the knife. As an aside, I'd be shocked if the developers of 'Soma (2015)' haven't seen this; the two pieces have quite a bit in common. That's not a sleight on either party, mind, just an observation. In the end, this is one of the best episodes of the entire show. 8/10"
2,7, 9,9.0,Very nice episode that's what exactly what I want to see.
2,7," ""It wasn't really real, so it wasn't really barbaric.""",8.0,"Imagine having a block function from social networks available in real life. In the unspecified future, people have chips in their temples, similar to those in The Entire History of You, which, among many other functions (such as taking photos by eyes), allow them to block other people, so that they can no longer see or hear each other.In addition, the extracted chip automatically becomes your mental clone, a self-conscious copy of your mind that functions independently of you.Both of these chip functions are very useful in this futuristic society, but, as in previous episodes, the question arises again as to how ethical and humane modern technology is, and whether it is worth the risk of countless possibilities of abuse.The script consists of three intertwined stories, incredibly well worked out in just over an hour. The story is complex just enough to maintain attention and tension without getting lost in the perplexity. Great actors bring us well-written characters with whom it is easy to identify, so, in addition to an interesting premise, which makes us introspect, we also have a strong emotional drama. And like the icing on the cake, the episode ends with a pretty effective twist.An additional plus for me is the presence of a large number of ""easter egg"" references to almost all previous episodes, which indicate the possibility that all previous ""Black Mirror"" stories are placed in the same time frame. Perhaps the best episode so far.8,5/10."
2,7, Season Two,7.0,"After watching the First Season (3 episodes) of Black Mirror, I was intrigued enough to keep going (albeit not exactly sold on each hour).For the first three episodes of Season Two, I experienced much of the same. Some things I liked...somethings I did not. Again, as was a problem in S1, the show seemed to focus on the technology of each episode instead of developing the characters to their fullest.But then comes ""White Christmas"" (the finale of this season), and that episode changes everything. Starring Jon Hamm, this episode really showcases the type of storytelling that Black Mirror could (and should) be focusing on. This single episode is head-and-shoulders above everything that precedes it.So, on the whole, this is a 3.5 star season from me. However, the large caveat is that it looks like the show may have figured out the winning formula to maximize its potential. It will be very interesting to see if the momentum can be sustained into the third season."
2,7, Hell in snow for Christmas,9.0,"A strange situation, or maybe two strange situations. On one side a peeping-tom voyeur who uses modern technology to get inside the bedroom and the bed of two people who are going to have casual sex, the man having been guided step by step into the situation and into this end by the voyeur and his audience. But unluckily the woman is different and for her, this sex episode has to be the full and final contact with the man she has selected, and thus sex for her is death for both.The voyeur did not report the crime and thus is in custody pending some sentencing.On the other hand, a young man discovers by accident his wife is pregnant. She declares she wants to get rid of the child. He refuses. She uses some advanced technology to block him for her. Both cannot have any contact at all until she lifts the blockage. But she dies in a car accident, leaving the child behind in the hands of her father.The supposed estranged father is no longer blocked and he can approach the child. He discovers the child is not his, but that of an Asian friend of the family. Out of rage he kills the father and abandons the child who dies in the cold outside when she leaves the house. The man is imprisoned and the victim of a sentence that blocks him in the father's house, the child dead outside in the snow, but he refuses to confess and there are no witnesses.The police use the great competence of the voyeur to project himself into the house and lead the man to confess his crimes. He is condemned to spend an eternity in this house with blaring Christmas music, each one of the real-time minutes is experienced as if it were five years long. The voyeur as for him is free but he is blocked by everyone and is thus condemned to have no contact whatsoever with any human. Tomorrow technology is leading us to the worst possible enslavement to the police, the state and some kind of fatalistic future. To get some pleasure and adventure you have to break the law. There is no escape: it will be known sooner or later and then you will be turned into some kind of virtual being going through some unimaginable torture. Welcome to hell on earth and in prison.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
2,7," The most memorable, although unpleasant on many levels",8.0,"Thanks to the smooth, handsome presence of Jon Hamm this is an eminently watchable episode. However, Hamm brings across some of the creepiness of his Don Draper character.Stuck in an outpost with a ""colleague"", named Joe, the Hamm character (named Matt) starts telling how he ended up in the allegedly sh**y job, far removed from society. As a sidelines from his main job, Matt used to run a sort of dating service, giving real-time advice to insecure men on how to hook up with girls. Unethically, Matt shared these experiences live, with his previous clients. Voyeurism turns into Matt's demise, when one of his clients hooks up with the wrong girl. Then Matt starts talking about his main job and from this moment it is clear where the episode is heading. Matt's job is actually convincing his ""colleague"" Joe to open up about his past and since Matt is so smooth you can bet he will succeed.The story takes place during the Christmas period and the festive atmosphere adds more creepines to the unfolding tale. Do not expect a happy ending (sorry Matt, not even for you, since you don't deserve it)"
2,7, Fan-freaking-tastic,9.0,This is an insanely awesome episode of TV. Twists and turns every 10 minutes. Fantastic plot development. The best episode.
2,7, One of the best episodes of Black Mirror!,10.0,"This one hits hard and is an illustration of human cruelty that is, at times, difficult to stomach.The blend of stories in this episode is a winning formula and all three stories are compelling and each gets increasingly more disturbing.The cruelty is so well desgined it is easy to empathise with, this makes it an emotional ride throughout and has you questioning whether the human psyche could actually cope with the trauma and torture of these futuristic devices.The concepts are genius and the execution is brilliant!10/10"
2,7, Masterfull!,10.0,"WHITE CHRISTMAS can easily be called the best Black Mirror episode ever, and based on it's lofty 9+ rating, not surprising. A clinic in atmosphere, storytelling, writing , and acting, White Christmas incorporates various technologies already presented on the series and expands upon them to a point where it seems like the future has been laid out. Anchored by a brilliant, award-worthy performance by TV icon Jon Hamm (Emmy winner from Mad Men), this episode is captivating start to finish. White Christmas starts off in a remote cabin with 2 men seemingly imprisoned there, cut off from society. The 2 men are Matt (the aforementioned Hamm) and Joe (a superb Rafe Spall), who share each other's stories in an effort to break the boredom, all the while cooking up and feasting on a very British Christmas meal. Joe is actually British while Matt is an American living in England.We find out that Matt is a manipulative, smooth-talking closer, both in his day job and his extracurricular activities, while Joe is a more innocent, humane person who seems like he couldn't hurt a fly. Layers and layers are deftly revealed throughout the episode, all the while some nifty technology is showcased, including that Bluetooth-like eye technology first shown in The Entire History of You, as well as a much more advanced version of the digital cookies tech first shown in Be Right Back. But the director smartly mixes the technology into the story, and not allowing it to dominate. Instead the very real and true human characters shine.In addition to the 2 great leads Hamm and Spall (both of whom should have won awards), the supporting cast, including a now fairly famous Janet Montgomery, all make this splendid episode come to life. In particular, Oona Chaplin (as Greata) and Rasmus Hardiker (as Harry) stand out as they played big roles in 2 of the 3 stories. Interestingly, this was really a Special Christmas episode, but has been coined as the official last episode of Season 2 (even though it came out close to 2 years after the end of that season), then Season 3 came out two full years after this. I think the series didn't really garner worldwide attention until Netflix took over. A shame because I feel this masterpiece of an episode deserved serious acclaim and award recognition."
2,7, Interwoven cautionary tales on the dangers of brain-technology hookups,9.0,"""Black Mirror"" doesn't really do feelgood Christmas, so there is only the flimsiest of connections here - and that's OK. Basically this one's about downloading enough of a person's brain patterns to generate a pseudo-human being inside a computer framework. But it's also about implants allowing people to block out the words and appearance of others if they so wish, or en masse as a form of punishment. These are then exquisitely devious and truly awful ways of making people - or pseudo-people - suffer, and there are really no holds barred to the subtle forms of torture depicted in this extended episode.Found myself wondering what a person who for years could only see blurred images and hear blurred voices of people around them would do. Thank God (literally) nature and architecture would still exist, and would doubtless become a life focus for such unfortunates. The (fortunate!) unreality is arrived at when one asks how such a punished person would purchase anything at the supermarket! Obviously, this plotline cannot actually work - though that doesn't make the thing much less oppressive.A similar - tangible - claustrophobia arises with the entrapment in software of a person's brain patterns. And shades of ""Never Let Me Go"" here, as a person actually has an operation to have this second self removed and put into an Alexa-type piece of equipment that then runs the house for - and the lives of - the organic originals. The copies don't actually like that role very much, so cue episode star John Hamm as a person in an entirely new profession - the breaking and taming of those entrapped as intelligences wholly deprived of human rights and freedoms but still feeling human, who are needless to say unwilling to cooperate. So what does he do? He speeds up the timeframe from our point of view, while letting those inside the software believe that weeks, months or even millennia have passed. And, since the only worthwhile activity left for these beings is back out in the ""real world"", the blocking of contact with that world is an unimaginably cruel deprivation. Basically, then, that's awful new form of torture number 2!Another sideline of this character called ""Matt"" is that he previously acted as an online life coach to people whose eyes can now beam back each happenning live, allowing Matt (and in fact also his backup team of online geeks) to give the best advice to the person with the implant, potentially allowing them to hit it off with potential dates. This is more conventional ""Black Mirror"" fare, perhaps, but still creepy and redolent with exploitation and manipulation.Matt also has a role in trying to get the detached intelligence of a flesh-and-blood criminal to confess, with the charge and punishment then being passed back to the ""real"" killer.You see how ""convenient"" these stored intelligences can be?The way these stories interlock through Matt is great, if definitely full of disturbing dystopian aspects; and on the way we get to see some pretty good acting from Oona Chaplin, Janet Montgomery, Rafe Spall and others.And, by the way, we know it's alternative reality, because in this version of the UK snow is a regular feature of winters! A clever touch to a clever episode of a mostly-clever series, I must say...But all is indeed very, very COLD!"
2,7, A focused special episode,9.0,"This review contains spoilers.The episode opens with Matt, played by Jon Hamm, and Joe, played by Rafe Spall talking in a cabin. They both discuss their pasts as they await Christmas. The world in this episode utilizes cookies, blocks, and 2-Eyes. This world is a more connected and technologically advanced society. Matt in this episode recounts using the 2-eyes to both spy on and assist men find women. The society also uses cookies and blocks to stop communication from people in real-life. The cookies are used to create artificial intelligence from someone's own memories.White Christmas is a strong episode for Black Mirror. This episode has great performances from its actors. The highlight actor here being Jon Hamm. This world is also fun to explore and see. Although this episode can elicit sad emotions, the episode keeps this in mind and delivers a great plot. There is a lot going on in this episode and its long runtime helps deliver the story.The last act of this episode is a great culmination of what the episode leds up to. The intersection of technology and cruelty is at the focus here. The blocks can render people only more obsessive and this is reflected with Joe. I felt for Joe as I saw his story play out.I highly recommend Black Mirror's episode ""White Christmas"".Grade: ABlack Mirror Season TwoThe second season of Black Mirror contains three episodes and a special episode. The second season it takes more of its episodes from the third episode of the first season. The second season explores alternate realities with more a science fiction twist. This second season is an incredibly strong season. the weakest episode is ""The Waldo Moment"" but even this is still a strong episode.Each of the episodes explores a separate theme related to its central point of people. The Christmas special episode in particular shows the effects of a block on people that exists in real-life. This season is not a happy season with much of its themes being derived from the more negative emotions of humanity.Like the first season, none of the episodes are linked in any way. Although this is fun to explore, I would have liked to know more about some of the worlds in this season's episodes.I highly recommend the second season of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
2,7, blew it at the end,5.0,"wpersonally I found the last several episodes of this series to be weak, flimsy, or bogged down by a morality system that seems so abnormal as to be alien.this episode was strong almost all the way through, with great storytelling aspects gradually connecting each story until you piece together just what's happened. ideas like the person-blocking is mindnumbingly fascinating and painful and even explored to a tantalizing degree without overdoing it.then the alien morality kicks in with an end that just completely sours the entire episode. the protagonist of the story has basically used his people skills and gotten into serious trouble, and now is using them to get out of trouble, helping police officials in extracting a confession out of a computer program copy of a killer who has not spoken to anyone in real life.His reward is he doesn't serve jail time for his own incredibly minor crime, and is basically worse than death; he's blocked by everyone, as a result of being put on a ""peeping tom"" list only vaguely reminiscent of real life sex offender registries.This is effectively a death sentence, as someone who is blocked by everyone basically cannot interact with anyone in any way. As such, they cannot hold a job and make money to pay rent or buy food or medicine or clothing, cannot communicate with emergency personnel in the event of a medical emergency, so he's essentially dead the moment he suffers a heart attack or a stroke or a blown appendix.He's got a good face and is charismatic, he makes his living off talking to people and getting them to open up. Being unable to do that, he's on the streets, a perpetual outcast, blind, deaf, and mute, on top of having a special red glow marking him as a sexual predator with no explanation as to whether he's an insane violent serial rapist killer or just a guy who watched some people have sex. He's dead within a year, of illness or victim of violence.to add on to the abnormal morality, the alien creature posing as a human decides to punish NOT the actual killer, but the computer copy of the killer to essentially an eternity of being trapped alive in a cabin with Christmas music playing nonstop.The unusual fixation on this sort of alien sense of morality that keeps getting tacked on to the end of these episodes (like with ""White Bear"") becomes hugely distracting and detracting from the episode as a whole, like following up a fine meal with an unexplained vomit-filled balloon dropped onto your plate and exploding in your face. Sure, the food was good, but what was the point of the vomit bomb? What am I supposed to learn from this? Now the vomit part is all I will remember."
2,7," Awesome idea and premise, but all consequences are highly exaggerated",8.0,"The idea and underlying questions of this episode are phenomenal, and I understand why it's regarded as one of the best episodes. Questions of morality and benefits of duplicating consciousness, and the rights of a synthetic consciousness, lack easy answers but are increasingly relevant. The gradual reveals showing more about each of their characters, the world they inhabit, and why they're really there is all extremely well done. It truly took me out of the story when characters repeatedly way overreacted to everything. Both of their wives freak out and block them over not that insane things - a verbal fight over abortion and running an illegal business helping men talk to women. Then, in addition to the blocking, they are given crazy legal punishments - being driven completely insane by immorally subjecting the clone to years of isolation and being blocked from literally everyone in society. It's such a good episode in all of its ideas and script, but the results were just so unreasonable."
2,7, How'd like your Toast ? White maybe ?,10.0,"One of the greatest pieces of T.V. put together IMHO in the history of the smaller screen. Period.John Hamm better than Mad MenIts just so intriguing, what a wonderful way to celebrate Christmas or any day.Arrrrrrr yes looking into a black mirror on Christmas day.Solid 10"
2,7, Im dreaming of a .....,10.0,"Bonus 3 stories in one and for those who like Easter Egg bonuses then this is cram packed with post episode and pre episode its the gift that just keeps giving.The first major US star , an unforgettable twist which then as a bleak black mirror twist with finally the most .... well its up to you to watch it.I wouldn't be surprised if this season 2 classic isnt a lot of people's fave but mine is white bear , this still however is a solid 10 out 10"
2,7," A review of Season 2 of ""Black Mirror"" (2013)",9.0,"""Black Mirror"" seems to me to be  the best science fiction show on television; I'd rate Season 2 (2013) a 9 out of 10.  (I'm never quite certain whether to group British shows by ""season"" or by ""series,"" as they do.  I'm also a little uncertain why the fourth and final episode here, ""White Christmas,"" is included in Season 2, as it aired nearly two years later as a 2014 holiday special.)I commented to a friend of mine after seeing ""White Christmas"" the other night that the show was ""brave"" -- it just isn't afraid to alienate mainstream audiences by being too dark.  Not all of ""Black Mirror's""  episodes have ""twists,"" but they typically have an unexpected plot development, and their outcomes and implications are arguably depressing.It's just such a damned good show, though, in terms of its writing and acting.  My friend told me she wasn't aware of anyone who had seen it and disliked it. ""White Christmas,"" for example, was one of the best hours of science fiction television I've ever seen.  It consists of three blackly tragic vignettes seamlessly woven withing a wraparound story, and it employs a sci-fi plot device that is mind-bending and brutal.  I believe this is the first time I've seen its lead actor, Jon Hamm, and I was extremely impressed with his performance.My only quibbles with the program are extremely minor.  As with the first season, I think that not every episode truly requires a 44- minute running length.  I thought two episodes  (""Be Right Back"" and ""The Waldo Moment"") seemed like they could have been tightened up into one, maybe with tighter writing allowing for shorter segments. I've noticed another minor relative weakness with ""Black Mirror"" in general as well -- the show does not always present the viewer with likable protagonists.  Occasionally, the various characters we're asked to identify with are either slightly off-putting or even annoying.  Again, ""Be Right Back"" and ""The Waldo Moment"" spring to mind.  This wasn't enough to greatly affect my enjoyment of the episodes, though.What an incredible show."
3,8, Not hard to envision this future....,10.0,"Season 1 and 2 of ""Black Mirror"" were made in the UK. After a hiatus, Netflix got involved and has financed new episodes...and I notice that the actors tend to be more American in the newer episodes. This one is the first of the new episodes...and a nice beginning it is. Hopefully the rest of the new episodes will maintain this momentum.In the very near future, social media has gone crazy. Now folks instantly rate each other...even when they have brief interactions, such as meeting on an elevator or waiting in line. Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) is very much a product of this environment and she works hard to present as a sweet person in order to get high ratings. However, lately her ratings have begun to slip...and this is a serious problem when she is trying to get to a wedding. Why is this wedding so important? The lady getting married is not really any sort of close friend...but this lady is SUPER-popular and might help Lacie to increase her rating just by hanging with her and being the best maid of honor in the world! But something HORRIBLE happens at the airport. What this is and how she deals with it is what makes this a very funny episode.It's an interesting coincidence that the same time this episode debuted John Fortson created a short film with pretty much the same theme. ""Rating"" is just as clever and is also worth seeing. And, most importantly, both have a lot to say about how crazy and potentially damaging social media is...and I pray it never gets to this...but wouldn't be surprised if it did.By the way, the ending of this one is VERY embarrassing....so hold on tight!!"
3,8, Another Look at Our Shallowness,8.0,"A culture has developed where people are rated on some arbitrary scale. The main character is doing whatever she can to get above her 4.2 status. People will reject her because they are ""superior"" in number. She is totally shallow, attempting to make the kind of connections that will boost her up a couple decimal points. So when she meets people, she can look at a phone and see what their level is. The way we treat people isn't much different than this as we look at things that have nothing to do with substance. As with most of these episodes, things are taken to the nth degree. Interesting encounters as she goes to the wedding of a beautiful woman who mistreated her but would be useful in upping her rating."
3,8, A Great Criticism to the Excessive Use of Social Media,8.0,"In a near future, people are rated by the others through the cellphone facilitating life or not depending on the personal rating. Lacie Pound (Bryce Dallas Howard) is obsessed by her high score and is very polite with everybody expecting to increase her rating. Her brother Ryan (James Norton) does not care and has lower rating irritating Lacie. When her best friend Naomi Jayne Blestow (Alice Eve) invites her to be her maid of honor in her wedding, Lacie foresee the chance to increase her rating and prepares a speech. When she arrives at the airport, she learns that her flight was canceled and she does not have enough rating to get a seat in another plane. She has a problem with the attendant and she is ranked down in the beginning of her downfall to a journey where she will learn the importance of being free to speak and act.""Nosedive"" is a witty episode of ""Black Mirror"" with a great criticism to the excessive use of social media mostly by the younger generations. Bryce Dallas Howard has an awesome performance in the role of a young woman obsessed by her personal rating that learns the importance to be free of the excessive use of social media. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Nosedive"""
3,8, A scary delve into what could be.,6.0,"I have to say I am stunned by the high score this one has, higher then many other episodes. I like the concept, I like the message, but the delivery I personally didn't care a great deal for. The harsh, bleak core of the show is lacking here, it's garish and syrupy in its execution, all the elements that make Black Mirror the addictive show that it is just aren't here. Nothing wrong with the performances, well acted, but almost all of the characters are loathsome, it's hard to believe that most people would be so shallow. The message is powerful, how many times does one walk into a coffee shop or step on a train and find everyone with their heads down transfixed by their phone, how many times do see companies desperate for feedback."
3,8," ""It was like taking off tight shoes.""",8.0,"I'm led to wonder how I would handle the social media world if I were in my Twenties or Thirties, since I'm a seasoned citizen now retired. There's the possibility I would be all caught up in things like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as a result of hanging with my peers, but the other side of me still cautions that I should be wary against the invasive nature of all these platforms. This episode takes the Twitter follower concept and adds an even more self absorbed element by way of the five star rating system that puts every one of it's users on a hopelessly frantic treadmill. Imagine hiring a social media coach to point out your areas needing improvement in the personal skills arena?I thought Bryce Dallas Howard did a nice job conveying the vapidness of her character. I could tell when I wanted to strangle her over the 'Lay-Lay/Nay-Nay' exchange with her faux gal pal Naomi Jane Blestow (Alice Eve). Nay Nay had just the perfect complement of friends and admirers attending her wedding reception. No doubt everyone coming out of that ceremony would have gotten a high five, five star rating as a result. For the sake of the story, Lay Lay's long, rambling descent into hysteria was nicely done and well expected, but wouldn't have had much of a chance of happening in real life. She would have been bodily tackled if necessary before putting such a damper on the whole affair. If you're wondering about my summary line, that's truck driver Susan (Cherry Jones) explaining how wonderful it felt for her to ditch the phoniness of going along to get along. She was about the only real person in the entire story, unless you want to consider Lacie and the man in jail (Sope Dirisu) at the very end of the story. It looked to me like they were falling for each other."
3,8, MeowMeowBeenz,7.0,"Having first watched seasons 1 and 2 (along with the White Christmas special) that were all filme in England, it was refreshing to see sunshine in this season 3 opener on Netflix. Even though Nosedive was set in the USA, it was filmed in South Africa, as I read somewhere that Charlie Booker says it's a nightmare to try to film in the USA.Anyway, this was a biting commentary on ratings (Uber, Instagram and of course iMDB!) and I was kind of hoping for some sort of redemptive scene at the end. But not to be really.Also, much has been written about the similarity of this plot with Community's season 5 episode App Development and Condiments, which was originally two years before Nosedive."
3,8, 3.5/5,7.0,"'Nosedive (2016)' is the first episode of 'Black Mirror (2011-)' to be produced by Netflix, shifting the focus over to America while keeping the same the 'tech gone wild' theming. The episode is set in a world in which everyone's worth is defined by an arbitrary rating system that dictates what you can and cannot do within society. This score is constantly changing, affected as much by chance encounters as it is by traditional social media posts. As such, those who want to achieve a higher standard of living must bend over backwards to please everyone they come across, basically held prisoner by their own aspirations. Those with a high score are viewed as worthy, while those with a low score are not. Of course, this is the episode's take on ethnic and socioeconomic discrimination. Our protagonist desperately seeks to raise her score above four and a half out of five so that she can get a discount on her dream home, manufacturing fake moments of happiness and ruthlessly shunning former friends along the way. However, despite her constant attempts to remain prim and proper to even the most distant stranger, she soon learns that the path to becoming a sub-three is a slippery one and that the whole system is built upon foundations of human suffering. As you can probably tell, the episode is chock full of interesting themes that it explores in an intelligent and entertaining way. That's what we all expect from 'Black Mirror (2011-)', I suppose. However, the thing isn't as gripping or generally affecting as the best episodes of the series. Still, it's a solid, enjoyable piece of television. 7/10"
3,8, 8,8.0,"It was quite decent beginning of new season. It shows a lot of real things. We all need likes for our pictures, we all want to be famous but it's not the most important things in the life."
3,8," ""There's sugary and then there's ... diabetes!""",8.0,"Another futuristic episode in which life comes down to popularity on social networks. Your every action, every word, is rewarded or punished by people from your environment by adding or subtracting points on your profile. From your position on a one to five stars scale directly depends your social position and your opportunities in life, from where you will live and what work you will do, to the most banal little things such as which car you will be able to get in the rent-a-car agency.We already have an extremely large number of mostly young people addicted to social networks, whose lives are reduced to Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. It is a common sight that groups of young people, instead of hanging out, stare at their phones. But social networks also have an impact on those who have not so obviously succumbed to them, because they greatly influence public opinion and all spheres of public life.This episode is not really SF, but a satirical exaggeration of the reality in which we live, and that is exactly what makes it more convincing and scarier than all that precede it. While in the beginning this caricature is hilarious, as the story progresses, the surreal comedy grows into a real drama with a quite tense atmosphere.Technically well done, with interesting solutions, a surreal atmosphere, and great acting and music, and most of all a topic that is extremely close to us, the episode had the potential for the highest rating. Unfortunately, the ending, although it makes sense, pretty much disappointed me. I think they could have finished it much more powerful and impressive.8,5/10."
3,8, Tripped on the ending,7.0,"I was really enjoying this episode right up until the last couple of scenes. I thought it was building towards a satisfying conclusion where her friend would get some kind of comeuppance. Instead I found that the wedding Party speech scene and the subsequent scene in the cells just felt zany and bonkers and manic without any purpose.I don't really understand why she was screaming that she loves her friend as she was dragged away. I don't feel like this element was established.I give it points because I like the idea of the episode re: social status credits and whatnot, and the majority of happy happy land was portrayed in an interesting way."
3,8, Most disturbing despite the soft look,8.0,"The contrast between the pastel-color photography and the bleak reality of an hypocrite society makes this episode a brilliant one.We open with the cheerful image of a pretty, well-dressed girl, living in a pretty, pastel coloured world... but unfortunately all that we see is fake. People spend their time obsessively rating each other, because in this society high rates work as a currency and allows you to have a better life.Consequently, social climbers lie all the time and many people try frantically to increase their rating overdoing what is already going on nowadays in social platforms.Everybody runs their own reality show, but they need an audience to share their successes, regardless of who they really are - and as it often happens, the most popular are also the most hypocrite.Dangerously close to happen IRL, as anybody knows we're already receiving requests to rate services... will people be next? And what about those who refuse to play this obsessive, hypocrite game?"
3,8, Dang,8.0,I hope this never happens in real life. My rating would be really lame and I think I would go crazy.
3,8," Loved this one, hillarious and also a genuine warning to a new generation!",9.0,"Nosedive is satire at it's very best!The story is so cleverly put together and played beautifully by the cast. It had me laughing my head off while shaking my head at the reality of the message aimed at our judgemental, social networking society. Of course, nosedive takes the message to a whole new level in classic black mirror style, but this is going on the world we live in today and frankly it's scary as hell to think that it may one day come to this!Quality epsiode that really makes you think 9/10"
3,8, Terrible,1.0,"This is the first episode of this anthology series I've watched and hopefully, the rest of the series isn't this bad! Was I supposed to sympathize with Bryce Dallas Howard's character? She was incredibly annoying throughout the entire episode, a fake nice person BEFORE she got wind of the fact that this faux society she lived in was a mirage full of phony, self-involved, self-congratulatory people. And why did she sound like a whiny teenager? She's pushing 40 in real life! LOL Her acting was laughably bad. I couldn't sympathize with her character for a second.In fact, the speech patterns of virtually all the characters were annoying. This is supposed to be the representation of a ""perfect"" world, and the people that talk and act like this in the actual world (yeah, they exist unfortunately) makes me want to plug up my ears. Thank goodness for headphones! And I guess the lesson is that Lacie (Howard's character name, yeesh) is going to end up like that old lady trucker she picked up, but that lady was actually NICE and COOL. There's no way Lacie will end up as genuine as her. The ending made it seem so (by the way, what was that?) but I think she'll just be one of those people that are mean to everyone minus any warmth or wisdom.The future look with the bright colors, pristine landscape, electric cars was actually nice. It's actual believable such a society could exist. And it wasn't the WHOLE society. You still had the gritty underbelly with the trucker lady, a dirt bike riding teen, the jerkish gas station attendant. The truck lady was the ONLY likable character in this and the only actor who brought it. Every other character reeked of awfulness, both in presentation and performance."
3,8, Societal Obsession,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.Black Mirror's first episode in the third season is called ""Nosedive"". The episode is directed by Joe Wright and the story is written by Charlie Brooker. The episode stars Bryce Dallas Howard in the leading role of Lacie Pound. Society has changed to incorporate ratings on each person. There ratings can impact someone's socioeconomic status.""Nosedive"" is an episode with a lot of real world influence. This episode has present day relatability through social networks such as Facebook and apps that allow you to rate people. The very idea on rating people is taken to the extreme in this episode. Entire interactions and purchases are not possible without a high enough rating. Although this seems unfeasible for a society to operate this way, the episode does still play it straight to satirize modern society.This episode is a complete satire of modern insecurity. The episode reflects this well with the main character of Lacie Pound as she embarks on a journey to raise her rating and join her upper class friend. Even without a modern rating system in today's society, many people are afraid of what others may think of them. The system stops people from taking risks. This is reflected well in Lacie's journey. As she traverses the country to get to her friend's party she has to deal with a world that does not always accept her fakeness and insincerity. It was a good scene to see at the end when Lacie finally accepted the system's flaws rather than continue being exploited by the rating system.The episode is incredibly colorful and this reflects the messed up situation the world is in. The episode's looks are clean but underneath the rating system has completely gutted genuine conversation and interaction. Everything is only clean on the surface.I highly recommend Black Mirror's episode entitled ""Nosedive"".Grade: A"
3,8, No finale?,3.0,After all that she still tried to make a good speech...It was soooo booring...THe whole episode was.
3,8, Jeeeeeeees do i know people like this,9.0,"My ex wife without the figure and looks of Bryce.
Yes this is an episode which is not a warning rather a observation amongst our young . Ok the rules are not in place but whos to say its not something this crazy world will never do.Great BM episode IMHO"
3,8, What we are.,9.0,"This episode explains you how much we pretend to fit in this world.
You laugh at joke of someone who is not even funny, you sit with someone who is not even kind, you smile with someone who don't care about you and obviously you do this all because he is famous.
Nosedive explains you there is no meaning of happiness which you get by pretending to be something, you should be happy for what you are and it makes you unique but then comes the society which is just a lie, cheating you for his own purpose.
So it is so simple try to understand those persons who are good to you in your bad situation because only those people matters."
3,8, Social Media satire,10.0,"Nosedive is the closest to our future now. Nowadays most people rely on social media, and their confidence depends upon it. It is really uncomfortable to watch this, mostly because it is so true now. The characters are becoming us now in this modern world.Bryce Dallas Howard deserved an Emmy for this episode."
3,8, 10 Star story idea. It just didn't need to be so long,7.0,The world created in the episode is very prescient. A world where everyone can immediate see and rank anyone's behavior. And the ranking becomes the standard for nearly every aspect of one's standard of life. From one's house availability to parking access in neighborhoods.There is a mutual benefit presented to lying about how one feels and looks. Meanwhile an inconvenient but honest critique gets you in trouble.THe flaw with this episode is that there wasn't enough story to fill the time of the episode. After a while you get the message and can predict the essence of the conclusion even if a few of the details can't be predicted. In the end the details are always going to impossible to predict and largely irrelevant.I feel they should have made this episode about more than one big story arc or else made it about 20 minutes shorter.Then it could have been a 9 or 10.
3,8, Plagiarism of Community,1.0,"This is by far the WORST episode of Black Mirror.With Mr Brooker having sold his soul to America, it was dispassionately obvious that the show was going downhill...This whole plot and story completely ripped off Community. They did it first and Black Mirror copied and made it disappointingly but unsurprisingly worse."
3,8, A Thought Provoking Message to All Social Media's (Virtual World's) Enthusiastic Blind-Fans !,9.0,"This is arguably one of the best Black Mirror Episode which I have watched just now. And I can definitely do hats off for it's creators for their portrayal of today's culture! This is our very near future's profacy, after social media's massive growth. Everyone just pretending that they're very happy in their life and greeting each other with fake Heavy-Smile to get a Good Ratings (Impressions) from them..Believe me Guys! You can definitely relate these rating systems with our real life things/products.This Ratings was used as a Metaphor for today's peoples thinking. This episode is too much real.I'm going with 9 Out of 10 Stars for this episode, because it's a metaphor of our near futuristic Black-world.But it have a Happy Ending to This Episode!"
3,9," I think in hindsight, Cooper made a bad choice....",7.0,"Cooper (Wyatt Russell) is backpacking though Europe and now that he's gotten to London he's having a problem. Someone on the other side of the globe just used his credit card number and now his account is frozen. Without funds he is in need of cash...and accepts an offer from a software company to demo a product for pay. But Wyatt is in for far, far more than he bargained as the game is completely real and preys upon his darkest fears.While this is one of the weaker episodes of ""Black Mirror"", this is is not really a terrible thing...as it still is quite enjoyable and worth seeing...even if they do use the f-word 17503 times!By the way, Wyatt Russell is Kurt Russell's son!"
3,9, On the Edge of My Seat,9.0,"A young guy who lives at home, leaves to go on an around-the-world adventure. His father has died of Alzheimers and he feels abandoned. He and his mother have issues. He is a vacuous kind of guy with little imagination and a fixation on modern technology. At one point he talks about how ridiculously boring it must have been in other ages (people actually read books--can you imagine?). When his credit card is compromised, he is stuck in London, and a newly found girlfriend tells him of a possible job. It is with a star video-game developer. Ultimately, after some rather suspicious agreements, he becomes a Guinea pig for the development of a terror game. He is injected with a device that allows his thoughts to become a part of the game. I won't spoil it but he is so naive and so stupid he get in way over his head. Of course, he is chosen because he can be manipulated. There are some interesting plot twists, but the star of the show is the world into which he is thrust. This is about as dark as it can get with some really startling graphics."
3,9, The Video game,8.0,"Cooper Redfield (Wyatt Russell) leaves his estranged mother at home in America to travel around the world. He ignores her phone calls and has good time. When he arrives in London, he meets a young woman called Sonja (Hannah John-Kamen) and they have one night stand. Cooper decides to return to America, but he has no credit and Sonja suggests he could test games at the SaitoGemu Company to raise money for his trip. Cooper is welcome by Katie (Wunmi Mosaku) to test a new technology developed by the owner Shou Saito (Ken Yamamura). He deliver his phone to Katie that turns it off but when she leaves the room. Cooper takes a picture of the technology and sends it to Sonja. Katie returns and implants a device in the back of his neck. They go to a house where the game begins and soon Cooper is not capable to distinguish what is real and what is augmented reality. ""Playtest"" is another great episode of ""Black Mirror"" with a good story of virtual reality. The episode is tense form the moment Copper arrives at the video game company and has a surprising conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Playtest"""
3,9, Edge of the seat viewing.,10.0,"This episode packed in so much, talk about a thrill ride. After a slightly casual, meandering start it develops into what has to be described as classic Black Mirror. When these episodes hit on a theme or a concept that makes you say to yourself 'that could possibly happen,' they work better, and boy this one is along those lines. With the advancements in gaming tech over the years, why on Earth couldn't something like this happen. Outrageous production values, a terrifying concept, fabulous performances, notably from Wyatt Russell and Wunmi Mosaku (the latter being one of the best British talents we have!) all elements add up to make Playtest a rip roaring ride of terror, 57 minutes you'll not want to miss.Would you kindly open the door?"
3,9," ""I have always liked to make the player jump.""",8.0,"Ever have a dream that just seems to go on an on, with so much happening that it feels like you've been inside it for hours or days? And you wake up, and it's only a few minutes since you noticed what time it was before you drifted off to sleep? Aside from all the horrible things that Cooper Redfield (Wyatt Russell) experienced during his 'playtest', the thing that blew my mind was that Cooper died only .04 seconds into his experience! Not much latitude there for correcting things that might go wrong. A possible explanation in the story came from the unexpected call to Cooper's phone interfering with the Harlech Shadow game programming. Considering Black Mirror's effort to keep the viewer off balance and to expect the unexpected, this episode was another resounding success. The mastery of the writing effectively disorients the viewer into thinking that certain aspects of the story have concluded and then you're right back into the virtual reality world once again, never having left. I've never experienced any form of VR myself, but a story like this makes the case for saying 'Stop' before even getting started."
3,9, Playing up,5.0,"Maybe I'm being a bit too unfair in comparing the Netflix reincarnation of Black Mirror to its original Channel 4 seasons 1 and 2. This had an intriguing plot but I'm afraid Wyatt Russell's SHAKING AND SHOUTING was somewhat way over the top. It seems Wyatt tried to channel Jeff Bridges or Nick Nolte. The ending was somewhat pro forma, and almost Twilight Zone-ish for Black Mirror tastes.Hannah John-Kamen was worth watching as Sonja, as was Wunmi Mosaku as Katie, and Ken Yamamura as Shou."
3,9, Playtime's over.,7.0,"'Playtest (2016)' focuses on a young man who gets involved with a mysterious augmented-reality game when he takes a games tester job in order to make some money after his credit card is cloned while he's on a backpacking trip. The bulk of the piece is centred around the protagonist's stay in a spooky old mansion, during which time he is assaulted by visions of his worst fears thanks to the experimental implant plugged into his brain by the developers of the game he's testing. It's typically atmospheric, suitably unnerving stuff. It does a good job of keeping you wondering how real its horrors actually are, as a number of them seem to break the 'it can't hurt you' rule that the developers insist is true. It's generally an entertaining time, well made in pretty much every regard, but its ending lets it down significantly. It goes one step too far in trying to convey the final gut-punch that conclude most 'Black Mirror (2011-)' episodes, undercutting itself in an unsatisfying way. It actually feels a little pretentious, to be honest, and doesn't have the effect it's supposed to. Still, the in-the-moment experience of the affair is solid. It's a well-made short film with more emphasis on traditional horror than is typically seen within the series. 7/10."
3,9, 7,7.0,"It was a little bit too messy, hard to fallow the plot."
3,9, Virtually real,8.0,"Imagine a VR (virtual reality) horror game that reads your subconsciousness and personalizes itself by adapting to your deepest fears, so real (because everything takes place in your head) that your mind is not capable of distinguishing it from reality.""Playtest"" is a psychological horror mindfak, set in the environment of a retro ""haunted house"". The futuristic but potentially realistic premise, charismatic characters, great acting and directing, and an atmosphere similar to Poe or Lovecraft, make it my favorite episode so far. And the plot twists, although unoriginal, are only seemingly predictable and managed to surprise me and leave me under a strong impression.8,5/10."
3,9, Survival Horror,8.0,"This episode took awhile to win me over.At first I found the story dull and the lead actor came across as obnoxious and overconfident; not a character I cared about or cared to know more about.
However, as he descends into paranoia and terror I feel the actor did a commendable job at accurately portraying the panic of the situation. We start to really feel the horror that he is feeling.The Cupboard jumpscare scene where the episode starts to think ahead of audience expectations (and speaks aloud to our thoughts) is where I realised this was going to be a bit more intelligent than I initially expected. It's cleverly done.Had a feeling that the interference from the phone call would be relevant to the story - I'm glad it was explained To a satisfactory extent.Although the idea that he was going to be repeatedly ""stuck in the matrix"" was a pretty obvious one to predict, it's still executed in such a way that it doesn't solely rely on surprise twists to be a satisfying viewing experience.Especially appealing for fans of the survival horror gaming genre.I wasn't completely convinced of the family relationship aspect of the episode - that could have been tweaked a bit or examined in a better way. It didn't really adequately explain why he would abandon and ignore his mother in that way."
3,9, Perhaps two plot twists are a bit much...,7.0,"Main character Cooper is an easy-going American backpacking around the world. He gets stuck in the UK and embarks on a dangerous test for a new ""virtual reality"" game.Due to the nature of the story, it was easy to foresee lots of techno trickery. Also due to the gaming nature, I was hoping for a more light-hearted development. I am not really into ""horror games"" and many of the scary events during the test were just too theatrical to be scary.What spoiled the episode for me was the double twist. I think the first one was effective enough, without adding the second. But see for yourself...."
3,9, Terrifying. Really,9.0,This is one of the scariest pieces of media I have ever witnessed. It's really freaking scary.
3,9," The burning question, would you play?",9.0,"A great black mirror delve into a classic horror concept.I love the horror genre and crave things that scare me. Playtest takes horror to a new level, taking your own fears and turning them against you!Fantastically imagined and well executed, if this bares any resemblence to horror gaming in the future, I wanna play! (Once the technology is tried and tested of course lol)9/10"
3,9, What a terrible episode!,1.0,"I thought Nosedive was bad, but PLAYTEST is even worse! And the main thing in common is in both episodes, I can't stand the main character. Nosedive starred Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron), while Playtest stars Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt and Goldie). Black Mirror should stick to actors who don't have famous parents from now on. Russell's character was too loud, abrasive, and obnoxious for me to root for him. I just didn't care about this guy. The episode itself was a bore. The first quarter was watching him travel around the world and get laid, then the chick he met on the dating app (only good character in this thing) sets him onto this virtual reality research facility that pays test volunteers to help develop their equipment. The man needs money because spent it all on his world tour. The segment is supposed to be a combination sci-fi horror story but there was very little of either. The ""horror"" was just a couple of jump scares and the sci-fi was barely seen. And other than that girl he hooked up with, the characters were bland. Russell's acting was way OTT and really bad in parts, the Saito guy's acting was bad, and his assistant was too monotone and kept distracting me with that stupid skirt that exposed her entire left leg. Who wears crap like that, especially at a place of business? Her incessant monotone was almost as bad as Russell's incessant yelling. These first 2 episodes of Season 3 were SO bad, I'm surprised at how utterly brilliant the rest of the season ended up being. How did this episode get rated so highly? Sad this and Nosedive are being lumped together with the remaining 4 episodes of Season 3, which are actually worthy of the Black Mirror tag. These first 2 are definitely not."
3,9, It absolutely blew my mind!,9.0,"I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish. Wyatt Russell delivered a powerhouse performance portraying the extremely likable protagonist. I found the concept to be quite relatable and really well-executed, although it's by no means new. The twists and turns are so effective. The way this episode ends sent shivers down my spine. The setup is a bit longer than it should be, though.I know this may be an unpopular opinion to have but this is my highest rated, and probably my favourite, Black Mirror episode I've seen so far.(9/10)"
3,9, Holographic Horror,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.The second episode of the third season of Black Mirror is titled ""Playtest"". The episode is directd by Dan Trachtenberg and is written by Charlie Brooker. The episode is about an American that becomes stranded overseas. Cooper, the marooned American, enters into a one-time playtest for a holographic videogame.Playtest is a story with a clean plot and setup. The episode relies a lot on the visuals and acting. They are up to par in this episode. It was great watching the episode play out as so much of the episode had great pacing that escalated the tension. This was felt as the episode moved on to explore the theme of horror.This episode is much more straightforward than earlier Black Mirror episodes. It is only at the end that the theme of personal horror becomes apparent. I enjoyed the slow reveal a lot as it reincorporated parts of the introduction. It also added more depth to the character of Cooper.The episode uses video games as more of a backdrop to explore the theme of horror. This was a good approach and lead to a fun episode. I would recommend ""Playtest"".Grade: B"
3,9, Am I high?,2.0,This episode makes me feel like I took something. And it was a bad trip. You never know what is going on. Its just a mess of all of his fears and in the end...its a pretty pointless and boring ending
3,9, Maybe the whole thing is a dream?,2.0,"That is really the only explanation for how a guy could stroll into town...start swiping right and immediately find a hottie. And he is ugly too...That would mean that she would have had to be on the app and had swiped right on him...but he just got there so she couldn't have,....THis was still more interesting than the entire rest of the episode.."
3,9," Wow , twist you mind on this .",9.0,"A great black mirror, super journey and a shattering black mirror ending. Read the small print when taking part in trials . And always phone ya mummy."
3,9, A very promising episode somewhat let down by the ending.,7.0,"Throughout the first three-quarters of the episode, I thought that it was going to be a home-run. A likable protagonist is established. He is thrown into an interesting new situation. Things get creepy and mysterious. Tension is built. By all accounts, this should have been great. But then, the last ten minutes really go completely off the rails. The ending is completely incomprehensible... though to call it an ending is a bit reductive since it is actually multiple endings layered within one another. Any one would have made sense and been satisfying on its own. But cobbled together as they are, it makes no sense and is tremendously disappointing. It feels like they wrote and filmed multiple endings and couldn't decide which one to go with so they just threw them all in.The episode follows an American near the end of his trip across Europe. In London, he accepts a one-off job play-testing revolutionary new technology from a major games developer. While the technology is successful, it may just be too successful..."
3,9, Scary Gaming Addiction,9.0,"This episode is a scary preview into the future of gaming addiction. It is a satire of gaming addiction, how literally deadly it can be. I even saw on a local news that a person died after continously playing for many hours. So this episode is really frightening."
3,9," Computer, end program",3.0,"Brooker clearly started with the last line and worked backwards. Sadly, what comes before doesn't justify the wag at the end of this shaggy dog story.The primary problem is that Hipster McDouchebag is an over-emoting superficial manchild with whom it's impossible to sympathise. I don't care about him, so I don't care about what happens to him. Why would I?Then there's the brain-simulation-gone-wrong plot, which is utterly hackneyed. It's been done before, repeatedly and better. This was a poor show from Brooker, and the self aware references don't excuse him looking backwards rather than forwards.The pacing is also badly done, with far too much irrelevant and uninvolving mundane filler in the back-story before we get to the near future payoff. Contrast with other Black Mirrors which make it immediately clear what the premise is going to be, and commit to it right from the first scene.Finally there's the whole tone of the piece proper, with an overblown score and too much shouting and arm waving - it's jarring and badly out of place in the Black Mirror oeuvre.If you like what makes Black Mirror great, you're not going to enjoy whatever this is. However, as usual, the True Believers have swamped IMDB with 10* shill ratings and reviews which makes it hard to get counter-point across. I hope that when they awake from their fantasy worlds that they'll realise what a poor decision that was."
