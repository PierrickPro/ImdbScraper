1,1, Perhaps accurate about human nature and the media...but too gross and easy to hate this episode.,3.0,"This first episode of ""Black Mirror"" is a lousy one because compared to later episodes it's very disappointing. It's also pretty revolting and I suggest you perhaps see this one AFTER you've seen a few of the better ones!The show begins by someone announcing on YouTube that he's kidnapped a member of the royal family. Their demand is that the Prime Minister have sex with a pig...live and unaltered on national television. Much of this episode is insightful when it comes to human nature and the media. That being said, surely there must have been a BETTER way to get the point than this...especially since it involves pork. You could do better and they DO get better."
1,1, Let's See If It Sticks!,5.0,"Other reviewers assure me that this series is worth a look. I agree with a previous commentator, that had this been the first episode I watched, it would be the last. It did pique my interest because all of us are voyeurs and are wondering how it will be pulled off. Well, no such luck. I thought that the writers would be able to come up with a satisfactory conclusion. So, it's performance art. So the guy who did it showed us our dark side. It's still disgusting and I'm not prudish about most things. The other thing is that no government agency would ever let such a thing proceed. I will watch the next one on the promise that something more palatable would come forth."
1,1," Sick, Tense and Realistic Story",8.0,"In London, in Christmas, the Prime Minister Michael Callow (Rory Kinnear) is awakened by his advisors Alex Cairns (Lindsay Duncan) and Julian Hereford (Donald Sumpter) that show a video of Princess Susannah of Beaumont (Lydia Wilson) to him. The princess is the pride and joy of the Royal Family and beloved by the people, and she tells that she was kidnapped. Further, the kidnapper demands that Michael have sex with a pig on live television; otherwise he would kill her. Michael's wife Jane Callow (Anna Wilson-Jones) supports her husband while his advisors try to hire a porn star to perform the act while the secret service tries unsuccessfully to track the kidnapper down. Meanwhile the media seeks for news at any cost. What will the prime minister do?""The National Anthem"" is the promising beginning of ""Black Mirror"", with a realistic and sick story of terrorism. The plot is tense and the attempt to find the responsible in short time is still impressive. The story shows the power of Internet and how unethical and destructive the press can be in certain situations seeking for a scoop. The conclusion is very ironic. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available on DVD and Blu-Ray"
1,1," Black comedy, but only just.",6.0,"I know the reviews for this one are generally hugely positive, but I find the first episode a bit of a stumbling block, When you think of subsequent episodes this one just lacks the true cutting edge. Sure it's a disturbing watch, and the performances are superb, fair play to Rory Kinnear, he is superb here, such an amiable actor, it adds to the repulsion and sorrow you feel for the character. The problem I have with this one, is the only picture I have in my mind is David Cameron holding that piglet, distressing all round. It's slick in delivery, it's definitely sick, just a story I'm not particularly struck on, a good watch though."
1,1," ""The Public, the Palace, and the Party insist on compliance.""",4.0,"I think we've pretty much hit the lowest common denominator here, haven't we folks? There are those reviews who claim that this show was meant to make us think, and that's probably true. I think it points out the cultural rot that's invaded our lives via easy to use technologies that make a connection with millions of people possible in an instant. I'm new to Netflix and 'Black Mirror', so I'm actually somewhat surprised that the terrorist act committed in the story hasn't been tried for real by now, since this episode aired back in 2011. But what the heck, with ISIS beheadings going viral and all manner of perverse images showing up on the Internet and spinoff technologies like Facebook and Twitter, it's probably just a matter of time. I can say one thing realistically, if this event were to happen for real, I would not be participating in the voyeuristic show, no matter how sensational. And if I were ever in the position of the Prime Minister, my reaction would be like the guy in the joke who encountered his friend, bitten on the butt by a rattlesnake. The alternative to sucking out the poison would be - 'You're gonna die'."
1,1, Incredibly bold and prescient,9.0,"With all the allegations (uncorroborated) around Piggate (just Google it), this series opener was incredibly prescient big time. Charlie Brooker is one talented guy, and his creation of Black Mirror really tapped into our social media/mobile phone/internet/Facebook obsession. This was before Pokemon Go by the way.This episode is disturbing in many ways, and you can sort of imagine pranksters pulling off such a stunt to humiliate those in power. Wow! Anyway, you are kept guessing until the end and you wonder will the British Prime Minister cave into the demands of the kidnapper? The end is skilfully filmed, and maybe there are DVD outtakes on this."
1,1, The episode that kept me for years from watching any more of Black Mirror,3.0,"After hearing about Black Mirror for a while, I thought I'd take a look, and took a look at the first episode. After 10 minutes I turned it off, although then mild curiosity lead me to read an online synopsis and took a quick look at the end. I didn't watch another episode for 4 years, because I couldn't see how anything that began so badly could possibly worthwhile. (Recently a friend who said this was the worst episode of the entire series convinced me to watch U.S.S. Callister, which was great, so now I'm ready to watch more).For me, National Anthem was a dismal fail. Basically it seemed to be a serious drama about an absurd situation. I actually started getting annoyed even before it got ridiculous because of the way the cabinet kept drawing things out for dramatic effect: Really? you're going to turn off a kidnapping tape in the middle to make some cryptic remarks before you let your boss the Prime Minister see the rest of it?Then the big twist came in and I was like, really?From what I've read there are other sensibility issues. Of course, satire doesn't have to make sense, but in spite of the premise, it isn't filmed like satire. And if you film it realistically, you need to give it a feel of realism, at least in the beginning (for example, Dr. Strangelove, which established a sense of reality before getting absurd). If the first five minutes had been done better, I wouldn't have been so put off by the central premise that I couldn't bring myself to continue.Why Black Mirror's makers felt this was the episode to start with is puzzling, although it's also puzzling why they would make it at all.If you haven't seen Black Mirror, don't start here."
1,1, Pigs might fly,8.0,"This has to be one of the most eye-opening pieces of TV I've ever watched. The premise is shocking to the point of unbelievability but a whole lot easier to accept now that the life-imitating-art story of ex-P.M. Cameron's university capers with a porker has come to light. Basically, a young Prime Minister, with similarities to let's say Tony Blair or the afore-mentioned then P.M. in waiting Cameron is woken up by the shocking news that the popular princess of the day, with similarities to let's say Princess Diana, has been kidnapped apparently by terrorists whose sole demand for her release is that said P.M. must commit a sex-act on live T.V. with a pig.It's realistically shot in almost real-time, with social media fanning the flames as the story spreads, augmented by ""Breaking News"" CNN / Sky News-type television updates making more tense the looming four o'clock deadline for the P.M.'s moment of porcine truth. Behind the scenes, every possible way-out is gradually closed down to him and the fantastical finale proceeds with the twist in the tale (or should that be tail?) as the truth is revealed, in the process making sense of subtly inserted seemingly unrelated trivial premonitions in the lead-up.As a commentary on celebrity culture, the eroded public perception of the status of politicians, the limits of censorship and just what people will and won't watch on their TV screens it's savagely on point, even more so today with ever more invasive reality TV shows given ever more network time.A piece like this couldn't work unless two vital factors were in play, firstly that it's played arrow-straight by all the actors and also that there's leavening humour inserted too (evident even in the title of the episode, as we wonder whether the P.M. will get up for his monarch). Both these boxes are positively ticked leaving the only really exceptionable segment being where a female reporter has to sex-text images of herself to one of the P.M.'s insiders to get an exclusive. I wasn't totally convinced by the last scene either showing how the P.M and his wife were coping one year on as I didn't think it added anything to the story.That said, I watched it with one jaw gaping and the other laughing at what I was seeing. This really does feel like it's pushing at the limits of television political comedy but rather like the depiction here of the various representatives of the British public unable to resist tuning in to watch, just you try and look away from this one once you've started."
1,1, Change the channel.,7.0,"'The National Anthem (2011)' is the first entry in Charlie Brooker's 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. It tells the tale of a kidnapper's unconventional and cruel demand: the prime minister must have sex with a pig on live TV. The piece starts out somewhat blackly comic, with the absurd request contrasting with the absolute sincerity with which it is treated. However, it soon becomes clear that this command is genuine and genuinely distressing. The experience escalates into a scrambled search for the kidnapper in an attempt to avoid what seems inevitable. The situation is properly tense and its culmination is properly disturbing. Rory Kinnear gives a great performance as a man pushed to the edge and the affair's pacing is veritably propulsive. It's not nice but it's compelling. It is also clearly trying to say something, which it does successfully without beating its audience over the head. Having said that, its observation does feel slightly 'empty'. It's not the most astute message but it works well enough. In the end, this is an entertaining - if not exactly enjoyable - short film with a dash of satire and a heap of horror. 7/10"
1,1, 9,9.0,It was so creepy and disturbing but also really entertaining at once. Really enjoyed first episode. Prime minister made the right decision.
1,1, What would you do?,8.0,"The princess was kidnapped. Via a YouTube video, the kidnapper demands that the Prime Minister have sexual intercourse with a pig in a live television broadcast, in exchange for the Princess' life. While police are trying to track him down, and the crisis staff monitors the reactions of the public, we observe the horrific dilemma of the Prime Minister who is slowly giving in to the pressure, until a complete breakdown.While the series is largely based on SF and futuristic premises, this episode is a purebred drama, quite possible at this very moment. The episode deals with the terrifying power that the Internet already possesses, the psychology of the masses, and the influence of the media on public opinion, questioning the policy of non-negotiation with terrorists, all through the prism of an individual in a hopeless situation.Although the script has some obvious flaws, and the episode somewhat flirts with black humor, the overall impression it leaves is deeply shocking, quite frightening, and thought-provoking.8/10."
1,1, Sex With A Pig,8.0,The Princess Susannah is kidnapped and her kidnapper had posted on YouTube a video. He wants the prime minister to have sex with a pig on live television.One of the reporters sexts photos of herself in the washroom. She goes into the supposed building where the princess is supposedly kept but instead gets shot by authority in the leg.The prime minister has no choice but to go ahead and do the act so he unzips his pants and we see him in his underwear. The pig is eating happily. He then performs the act and we see the audience's reaction.In the end the prime minister's approval rating has gone up a lot after one year but the only thing is his wife is not happy. She acts happy in front of the cameras but when they are home she stomps away. The princess is now pregnant.
1,1, An attention-grabber first episode,6.0,"I would not go as far as writing that I ""liked"" this episode, but for sure it attracted my attention.It works very well as a critique of a media-obsessed world, populated by hypocrites and voyeurs. It also strikes very close to our present situation and due to its dark nature, it is distubing. Likable, not so much, but definitely attention-grabbing."
1,1, Dare I say this might be a Marmite episode based on the reviews i have read!,10.0,"Boom!You can see from my rating how much I loved this episode. What a way to kickstart a new binge watch that I had been avoiding after seeing Bandersnatch last year!The National Anthem is a work of satirical art. It dared to suggest something so off the wall and ridiculous that it had me in shock and hysterics at the same time. It felt so fresh and original it drew me in and kept giving me more!I never believed for a second that the writers would actually see this through to it's conclusion, but hats off them, they dared to go there!Wow, all the craziness and satire was stripped away and replaced with something so perverse and sick I could really feel it! However uncomfortable it was to watch, I felt so sad for the lead character, sickened by the society, appauled by the reactions!For a story this silly to play out the way it does and still draw these emotions from the viewer has be the work of genius.Clearly many people hate this episode, I loved it!10/10"
1,1, What a Completely and Ridiculously Stupid Concept,1.0,I heard a lot of good things about this series and I had high hopes. If I can judge the series by S01E01 I would call it a disaster.People actually liked this episode? How is that possible? A kidnapped princess? I wouldn't wave to a camera to save a royal. Why didn't they make that royal pig have sex with the pig? If this is any indication of the quality of this series then I am getting out early.
1,1, The way we live now ... and it doesn't look too great,9.0,"In the first outing for Charlie Brooker's ""Dark Mirror"", a number of familiar-faced actors perform seriously and persuasively enough to capture the viewer within about 5 (of max 45) minutes, with a story presented seriously and realistically, and yet perfectly mixing the deadly serious with the eccentric and bizarre. It's a deeply British setting with just a hint of Doctor Who about it, and it homes in neatly on the tensions potentially and actually existing in the Prime Minister/British people/Royal Family triangle. Symbolic figureheads the Royal Family may be, but few in Britain have much doubt that - say - soldiers will ultimately do more to protect them than they will top politicians. In this case, it rather quickly becomes apparent that Brits expect a PM (and PM's wife) remarkably similar to David and Samantha Cameron to make a sacrifice for the sake of a young and popular Royal. The essence of this - in art here, as in real life - is just that the Royals are born into the job (whether they want to be or not), and in that sense somehow innocents, while politicians are elected and, if they can't stand the heat, they have no business being in politics in the first place.Anyway, what the kidnapper expects from the PM is bizarre (and all the more so given the apparently (truly) coincidental way in which life later (not until 2015, albeit retrospectively) apparently seemed to sort-of imitate art). In essence, it involves humiliation, and we immediately find ourselves wrongfooted by the fact that this terrorist demand - apparently associated with a genuine threat to the victim's life - does not involve money or deep political motives, but does require that the PM degrade himself publicly. It might be somehow funny or inconsequential in that case, but certainly does not seem so.The question mark here all the time is who is actually been targeted by the maker(s) of this piece, and the primary target would seem to be the electronically-connected world we live in. Certainly, there is tangible criticism for millions in the UK and around the world who are prepared to watch (and stay watching) the PM's humiliation, and in this sense - paradoxically - this modern, cutting-edge programme looks remarkably traditional in suggesting that the man at Number 10 is actually a hero who does the right (if nevertheless self-diminishing) thing.Happily, the kidnapper does not come out of this heroic, yet we still feel disturbed when we learn of his motive.Overall, it's clever and disturbing and dark, and definitely thought-provoking. It's also executed pretty deftly."
1,1, Strange beginnings,7.0,This review contains spoilers for the first episode of the first season of Black Mirror.The first episode of Black Mirror concerns a royal princess that is kidnapped with the ransom being the prime minister must have sex with a pig on live television. The episode covers the beginning from the ransom video being displayed to the revelation of the ransom. The British government is in panic as they seek to stop the media frenzy caused by the royal princess' kidnapping and ransom.The mystery of the episode is the best part. The revelation at the end being that the entire act was a work of art and reflection on modern society was great. This part elevated the episode for me and aided in the enjoyment of the episode.The characters of this episode are well-acted but the characters themselves are two-dimensional. Each character has a single motivation and that is all that carries them through the episode. The wife of the prime minister simply did not want her husband to engage in the act even when it was to save someone's life. It did seem like the episode should have focused more on the theme of the reflection on society rather than the focus on characters.The directing and editing are decent. The episode's visuals will not wow anyone but it will tell the story.I would recommend the first episode of the first season of Black MirrorGrade: B
1,1, The Power of Social Media,7.0,"Plot (3.5/5)Story (4/5)Soundtrack (4/5)They did it great.
Dialog (4.5/5)They speak way too fast.
Graphic (4/5)Reasonableness (5/5)All make sense.
Entertainment (3.5/5)Well, It is weird but also a bit entertaining.
Overall (4/5)This episode shows how powerful Social Media is. Even Government can't stop them."
1,1, He who laughs last,9.0,"I do believe that Mr Charlie Brooker no longer doing his 10 o'clock Live satirical news rival show decided that it would be great fun to do a story that attacked the then Prime Minister of Great Britain David Cameron.Cameron hated the comedians like Carr, Mitchell, Merton , Brooker etcBrooker didn't have time for The Tory partyEnjoy"
1,1, Degrading piece of garbage,1.0,"This program is described as being in the science fiction or thriller genre. Other people told me it was like a contemporary version of the twilight zone. None of these descriptions is remotely like what was presented in the first episode of the series. This episode is a twisted piece of filth that degrades the many British actors who lowered themselves to take part in it. It wasn't even much of a mystery, since there is a very clear spoiler early in the episode that gives away the name of the perpetrator. Don't waste your time. I will not be watching any more of this series. I wonder if this was written before or after the famous story about Prime Minister David Cameron and the pig."
1,1, Maybe something was lost in translation? Yank here.,2.0,"This is so bizarre and unpleasant to watch, it's amazing the show survived. I just wonder if there is a subtext here that Americans are missing."
1,1, Great start,8.0,"The satirical story is unsettling. Unlike the other episodes in Black Mirror, The National Anthem is set on the present and it deals with our obsession of social media and how news spreads like wildfire. And a PM doing it with a pig...really disturbing. But the acting is great."
1,2, Creative Second Effort,9.0,"This, of course, is an outrageous allegory about the foundations of our decline. The plot involves a man who seems to be comfortable. His bodily needs are taken care of. He seems somewhat free. But we soon find out that his daily routine is to get on a stationary bike and earn merits. These accumulate and can be exchanged for the the things that the governing body (whatever that is) is willing to sell them their products. They can get snacks from vending machines, watch pornography, mundane music, watch fat people being abused, on and on. They can also try to leave their station by giving up their merits in order to try to be celebrities themselves. It requires a huge number of merits (in the case 15 million) which could take six months to accumulate. Two people find each other and one makes a big sacrifice to allow that person to realize her dream. She must audition for three disgusting show-biz types in a kind of Hunger Games interview. We learn quickly that the decks are stacked and the prospect of pedaling a bicycle for eternity versus a modicum of celebrity is a hard decision. One of the most striking things about the episode is that people are represented to one another as avatars. When the girl sings in her audition, she sings before an arena full of cartoon figures who are the extension of real people. An excellent second episode after the first sickening one. I'll keep moving on to the third."
1,2, The Performances,6.0,"In a future society, most of the people work like slaves riding stationary bicycles to generate energy. In return, they receive ""merits"" that are consumed in fast-foods in vending machines and games and shows that they are forced to watch in giant screens in the single compartment where they live. When the worker Bingham ""Bing"" Madsen (Daniel Kaluuya) overhears his fellow worker Abi (Jessica Brown Findlay) singing in the unisex toilet, he falls in love with her. He convinces her to participate in the talent competition show ""Hot Shot"", where she may improve her life if she is selected by the judges Hope (Rupert Everett), Charity (Julia Davis) and Wraith (Ashley Thomas). Bing uses his savings of fifteen million merits that he had inherited from his brother to buy a ticket to Abi. However the judges offer to Abi to work in the porn channel ""Wraith Babes"" instead and she accepts the offer expecting to improve her life. Bing is angry with her choice and decides to save merits to go to the ""Hot Shot"" with a sharp piece of glass. What will he do in the contest? ""Fifteen Million Merits"" is a pointless episode of ""Black Mirror"" about a technological dystopia. The viewer sees the episode expecting something different and watches a weird story with an unintelligible speech. There is an obvious criticism to the excessive use of television, fast-food and video-games but the result is disappointing. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available on DVD or Blu-Ray"
1,2," ""I just want something real to happen. Just once.""",7.0,"Anybody here see and remember the movie ""The Running Man""? It starred Arnold Schwarzenneger and took place in a dystopian future in which the mindless masses were kept entertained with programs featuring blood and violence. You have pretty much the same thing here except the violence has been replaced by celebrity sex by players who pay their dues on the way to becoming the next 'Hot Shot'. All throughout, the story hints at the idea that the principal characters Abi (Jessica Brown Findlay) and Bing (Daniel Kaluuya) won't succumb to the relentless pressure of achieving that status, knowing that the only thing they each want to do is what makes them happy. But that choice is made impossible by celebrity judges Wraith, Hope, and Charity, who promise to send the fan favorites back to their lives of daily boredom scoring points while creating energy for the State and watching mind numbing programs of questionable value. An alternate ending in which Bing slashes his throat would have been considered more acceptable to this viewer, in as much as he seemed to be fiercely opposed to the choice he was offered, but in the end he too failed to deliver on his principles. Not that he had to be that drastic, he could simply have returned to his previous status. As Rod Serling once posited in one his more memorable Twilight Zone episodes, I guess it's all in the 'Eye of The Beholder'."
1,2," Seems so long ago, yet so prescient",8.0,"I still haven't seen Black Mirror season 3 onwards (I guess I have to subscribe to Netflix eventually). I'm only now catching up on three episodes from the early years: this and the third one in season 1, and the Christmas one with Jon Hamm.Fifteen Million Merits has several layers that is akin to a rorschach test. What you see depends on your priority in life. Consumerism? Capitalism? Talent shows? Simon Cowell? You have it all wen you see this."
1,2, I want to ride my bicycle.,8.0,"'Fifteen Million Merits (2011)' is the second entry in Charlie Brooker's 'Black Mirror (2011-). It's perhaps more typical of the series as a whole, with a single sci-fi premise at its core and a generally downbeat vibe. It's also highly satirical, a reflection of reality that's only become more relevant in the years since its initial release. Despite its heavy allegory and multi-faceted message, the piece remembers that it is, first and foremost, entertainment. As such, it's entertaining. It's also incredibly interesting and consistently compelling. It tells a fully-rounded story, with a tight script and a strong sense of design. The thing ties itself together wonderfully, culminating in an explosive finale that's truly great. Its first half, dedicated to establishing its world and setting up its extended meet-cute, is enjoyable and endearing. Its second, which is much darker, is straight-up gripping. You know something bad is going to happen but you really don't want it to, too invested in the central characters to care whether or not their suffering would make for better TV. It's really, really good. One of its best features is its star-making turn from leading man Kaluuya, which is still one of his best performances to date (it's not like he's ever given a bad one, though). His moment in the spotlight, as it were, is raw, visceral and properly powerful. It's a great end to a great experience. 8/10"
1,2, 7,7.0,"Basically the whole episode had an amazing idea which wasn't fulfilled 100 percent which is really sad. The idea about collecting coins like real life money buy stuffs is very nice but they should also add like when you have 0points you actually die in real life that would be more entertaining. The part when the girl was singing and became like just say ""web girl for cash"" was kind of hideous. She became to sing, she seemed to be very shy and thankfully she would never become ""web girl for cash"". The ending disappointed me when the main character grabbed the glass I was thinking he's going to kill jury but it ended miserably bad. So idea is great, fulfil was OK and ending was disaster. First episode was much better."
1,2, The Matrix vs The X Factor,8.0,"Today, more than ever, man is a slave - a slave to capitalism, consumerism, modern economy, and media brainwashing. We are trapped in a vicious circle of cash flow and our lives are spent paying bills, repaying loans, and constantly striving to stay afloat. The powerful manipulate our needs and satisfy them, probably largely unaware that, although on a different level, they themselves are trapped in the same game.With this satirical futuristic episode, ""Black Mirror"" brings this hopeless situation to an extreme, making the life of an individual completely meaningless. But the satire here is not achieved through humor, but through the depressing and uneasy atmosphere of the story of a society in which brainwashed individuals spend their lives producing electricity by endlessly turning the pedals, while virtual reality diverts their attention from general absurdity. And when a whiff of individuality and the will to change accidentally appears in one of them, they are effectively suffocated by skillful manipulation and the screw is freshly oiled and returned to the machinery.8/10."
1,2, Cycling Slave,8.0,"Bing is one of the many cyclers who do daily cycling to earn credits they can use to entertain and spend on themselves. He meets a woman who is blue-eyed and pretty. He hears her sing in the washroom and tells her he is going to gift her 12 million points. The girl gives Bing an origami penguin. They go to the competition together where the girl is made to take a drink and then sings. She is asked to lift up her shirt because he wants to see her titties. One of the judges insists she joins his show called Wraith Girls which is porn. The other white male judge agrees he would watch her and the woman says some girls might join to watch. The girl is taken to the show and Bing is in agony to see her in porn. Bing cycles to get to 15 million points and goes on the show, skipping the drink by using an old crumpled juice box. He threatens to kill himself with the shard of glass and says everything on his mind. The white male praises him and offers him a spot on his talk show. Bing takes it and gets to live in a beautiful white room with a wall showing the beautiful outdoors. He sips his orange juice."
1,2, Depressing but less creepy than episode n.1,7.0,"In the very near future (?), people spend their working hours in gyms watching stupid TV shows, to earn ""merits"" and become stars of those stupid shows. Besides being permanently stuck in the gym, they live in cubicles and even there they are forced to watch abysmally degrading entertainment, such as talent shows - wait a moment: this in not the future, this is right now....Anyway, the plot is about a guy who donates all his merits to a pretty girl, hoping she'll be the next talented singer to win a TV contest, but his plan backfires miserably.PS this episode reminded me of when I used to go to the gym and bike watching TV screens. Not my fondest memory...."
1,2, The revolution will be televised,8.0,"The world of Black Mirror is not one that anyone should want to live in. It's extremely bleak despite the technological advancements. This episode feels real to an extent, and that's what makes it great."
1,2, Beautiful Irony,8.0,This is one of the best if not the best episode about what Black Mirror is about. A clash of technology and human emotions. A great display of it.In the end it is truly ironic how the expression of emotions and calling the system out in a way results in turning and reinforcing the system. Intelligent and well ut together. Also the start of playing the recurring song Anyone. This is the episode that got me hooked on the series8.5/10
1,2," My least favourite episode of season 1, but it's still good",8.0,"Typically artsy and sylistic, you could say typically Black Mirror.Fifteen Million Merits is an entertaining ride that hits pretty hard at times. I love the satire and the darkness in this tale of a dystopian future where humans are little more than generators.Nothing to criticise here, strong characters and story, a solid episode!8/10"
1,2," Near-future dystopia, partly familiar-looking, partly with its own new forms of mediocrity and unpleasantness",9.0,"While the dystopia in this next offering of high-class and indeed mind-blowing British sci-fi obviously owes a debt to our country's ever-pertinent predecessor duo authoring ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"", Charlie Brooker does bring in certain inventive features all of his own here. And just like its ""Black Mirror"" predecessor episode ""National Anthem"", this one keeps allowing new ideas to unfold at each moment through to the very end, often surprising the viewer as this happens.In the meantime (and again in the same vein as with ""National Anthem"") we have multiple (conceivably even too many) targets having potshots taken at them, and the emotions come in thick and fast.The most Orwellian feature here is the sheer dullness of the everday existence presented. Nothing looks very high-class, and most things look artifiical, flashy, dumbed-down and childish - yet, while the people living this life do seem to have insight into this fact (certainly lead role Daniel Kaluuya as Bing seems to notice that ""everything is sh**""), and while they are not apparently forced to keep with this lowest common denominator by Big Brother/Thought Police/Room 101-like terror or even - most likely - by being drugged, as in the Huxley masterpiece, they do things as prescribed and play along...Why would that be?A clue may be provided with a further twist in the tale at the end, given the implication that these bits of human civilisation (if we can dignify what we see with that term) seem to exist in order to allow everywhere else beyond the confines of the centres we see to return to nature. That's a particularly paradoxical and chilling thought if the interpretation is correct.What price a restored environment?Yet this gels with the idea that the even-slightly-overweight are very much abused and looked down on in the society presented here - the implication being that they are taking more than their fair share of resources, or some such, and can to be mocked and abused for that.The beautiful and still-carefree 21-year-old Abi is an obvious reference to ""Julia"" in 1984, and of course she entrances Bing who is her Winston Smith. And just as Julia somehow lets Winston (and the reader) down in ""1984"", so the gorgeous Jessica Brown Findlay in the role of Abi accepts - very reluctantly, under merciless audience pressure, but nevertheless - that her lucrative, privileged if demeaning place will be in porn, rather than singing. Bing is similarly broken by this system (again a la Winston Smith), the thing being all-encompassing enough to allow him to preach a toned-down version of his diatribes against that very system as a new form of paid-for entertainment within the system framework!!And, this being ""Black Mirror"", the fact that Abi and Bing both escape the daily grind and go on to higher, more elite things DOES NOT mean them getting back together to rekindle the wonderfully inspiring love that they have experienced briefly.So all is miserable and maudlin once again, but certainly thought-provoking enough.Perhaps tyrannical discipline is really not needed in a world where people have nothing to spend unless they first exercise-cycle their way through energy production, then buy meagre rations and dire entertainment before starting the next bout of exercising ad nauseam.Indeed, much of that entertainment in its commercial aspect they will continue to receive UNLESS they pay ""merits"" NOT to receive it - a tragic and terribly scary twist denoting a default position in which everybody is soused with advertising or commercial pressures and content, unless they can afford not to be."
1,2, Monetary merits,7.0,"This review contains spoilers for the second episode of Black Mirror entitled ""Fifteen Million Merits.""The episode focuses on a society that is enclosed and automated Citizens here are frequently bombarded with advertisements. The most fit members of society that have not been elevated to the television generate power on stationary bikes for merit points. These merit points are used as currency.The episode focuses on Bingham ""Bing"" Madsen played by Daniel Kaluuya. The audience follows Bing as he navigates this strange world. The only way of elevating one's standing in the society is a ticket to being a hotshot where one performs in front of judges.This is a well written, well shot, and well edited episode. The episode flowed the freely and showed a dystopian society that had influences from Brave New World. Even the ending with a disillusioned Bing joining the very system he disagreed with is good writing.I highly recommend the second episode of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
1,2, This story as the X factor,9.0,Yep a story of many a twist and a novel way to create power source without any wars over oil.But when it comes down to the crunch how much is your morality and self respect worth?Get used to a certain tune
1,2, This is Art,9.0,Cycling continuously and earning points was so similar to us being in mundane jobs and accumulating points to pay off our bills. Even when we accumulate enough points and buy the golden ticket; we do not actually get what we were hoping for. We humans have made a viscous circle for ourselves that we can never escape from.
1,2, Very futuristic,8.0,"This is by far the most futuristic and eccentric episode. It is a satire of live TV contest shows. Like many of Black Mirror episodes, the story is also kinda creepy. Daniel Kaluuya is the star of this episode, and he's fantastic...and he's also hot."
1,2, All Style No Substance,3.0,"First of all, I will freely concede that the visuals of this episode look great. Overall I am still not impressed. I was told that this was supposed to be one of the best episodes. My main two objections are as follows. It moves way too slowly. There is lots of dull drawn out mundane and unnecessary parts. You could cut at least 15 - 20 mins and lose nothing significant. My larger objection is that the concepts and metaphors are not nearly as grand and intelligent as the critics seem to think. We are becoming slaves to technology... really? is that your high minded and profound social and political message? In some sense I do agree, but, this is not the cutting edge and brilliant art I was told to expect. I'm giving this show one more episode. If that does not impress me I am done. So far I think Black Mirror is completely overrated."
1,2, Dislike,5.0,Could be seen as an irony to capitalist ladder and all. But not worth 60 minutes. The universe is totally absurd and unrelatable for me.
1,2," Same Old ""Rats in a Race"" Concept",1.0,Same idea we've seen on other shows miilion times before. They didn't even do it well and the episode was way too long.
1,2, Absolutely Great!,9.0,"One of the greatest episodes of Black Mirror, just shows the genius of this show."
1,2, A Visually treat to watch this episode. 😍,8.0,"Wow.. Such a Nice world represented here in this episode.. According to the episode in the future Technology is pretty much advanced and people just tired with real money, so they're now dealing with Merit points and advertising industry have grown up so much there.
Nothing much to reveal about the storyline, but I'll say I just liked that ""Get Out"" Guy! Loved his acting and especially Dances and his epic Speech."
1,3, Where Does Humanity End?,9.0,"After one accepts the technology presented here, we get to see just how dangerous it is. People are able to recall every event of their existence--the images absorbed by an implant that more than half of society uses. People become obsessed with the gizmo and soon are sharing life events. The logical evolution of Facebook. But we are fragile figures. We still have emotions and we make mistakes. The main character is incredibly jealous of his wife's past. She is far from guiltless, but if one had to live with a paranoic, it wouldn't be hard to see things moving in the direction presented here. He comes home early from an interview and attends a dinner party his wife had thrown. In the mix is a man who seems to have more interest in the wife than the husband finds acceptable. With this ability to review the events of the past, he begins to search images. It's not that simple because there is subterfuge at every turn. This is another quite fascinating offering."
1,3, The Price of an Eternal Memory,8.0,"In the future, most of the population has a chip called Grain implanted to record and watch the memory of the entire life. After a job interview, the lawyer Liam Foxwell (Toby Kebbell) takes an earlier flight to meet his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker) in a dinner party with her old friends. When he unexpectedly arrives, Ffion is talking to her friend Jonas (Tom Cullen) and Liam finds her reaction strange. Then he watches her glances at Jonas during the dinner and he suspects they have a love affair. Liam presses his wife for an answer and she admits that Jonas and she had a love affair in Marrakesh before she meets Liam. They have sex and Liam spends the night drinking and reviewing the reunion. On the next morning, he drives to the house of Jonas and confronts him. What will be the price of his obsession?""The Entire History of You"" is another dark episode of ""Dark Mirror"", with a criticism to the excessive use of technology. What could be an argument between husband and wife becomes an obsession with the playback of past memories destroying their marriage. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not available"
1,3, 'Memory is for the living'.,7.0,"Does anyone doubt this is where we're actually headed? The only question I have is whether it will be voluntary or mandatory. Personally, I'm not even a Facebook user believing that it's membership requirements are too intrusive, but with the 'grain' implant, nothing in your life would be left to the imagination. You could simply call up your past experiences and be entertained or disgusted by them as the case may be. In Liam's (Toby Kebbell) case, he can't get past the idea that his wife (Jodie Whittaker) cheated on him and lied about it. I guess that's where the erasure option would be a good thing if you can call it that. Still, it would be a lot better to go against the grain in the first place instead of having to opt out at a later time."
1,3, Powerful story of who's your daddy - reminiscent of a real life Australian political sex scandal,9.0,"I'm finally catching up with the earlier episodes of Black Mirror. This searing episode is dramatic for sure, and is reminiscent of a real-life political sex scandal in Australia that was reported just a year before the screening of this episode.Thanks to grain technology where memories are stored (and deleted) and watched over and over again, Liam (a powerful performance by Toby Kebbell) suspects his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker, a few years before she become Dr Who) is having an affair with Jonas (Tom Cullen). Ffion and Jonas had a six month relationship before she connected with Liam.Through the grains, it turns out Ffion had a one night stand with Jonas around 9 months before the birth of her baby. Yes, Jonas is the daddy. This is reminiscent of the widely reported political sex scandal in Australia from 2010 where a guy, David Kuta, learned that his partner, Stephanie Hesford (who worked in Parliament) had an affair with member of parliament Kerry Hickey. Later Stephanie gave birth to a bouncing baby daughter, and David naturally thought he was the proud father...until he discovered the horrible truth that Kerry was the daddy.I felt sorry for Liam in this episode. I wonder what happened afterwards? Did Ffion and her daughter end up moving in with Jonas?"
1,3, Smile; you're on camera.,8.0,"'The Entire History Of You (2011)' finishes off the stellar first series of Charlie Brooker's 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. It uses its sci-fi premise to explore themes of jealousy, obsession and lies. In a world where absolutely everything is caught on camera, how can anyone even attempt to deceive? It's an interesting premise that's used as an entryway into its central character's relationship problems, which is an unexpected and equally as intriguing approach to the concept. Once everything has been set up, the piece spirals out of control and puts ever-changing distance between us and the protagonist by having him be unreasonable yet right. This delicate balance is preserved all the way until the end, which sees our hero at his most self aware. The strong performances from its flawed leads imbue the domestic proceedings with a real sense of urgency and desperation. In the end, short is compelling, well-written and entertaining. It's never quite what it appears to be. 8/10"
1,3, 7,7.0,Well for me it was too much of drama instead of interesting plot. The idea was good but it wasn't fulfilled.
1,3," ""Not everything that isn't true is a lie""",7.0,"In the undefined but near future, people have memory implants that record everything we see and hear, so we can access a detailed reproduction of every previous experience at any time, or share it with others on any screen available.One can no longer forget anything, but neither to hide. However useful and fun certain applications of this implant are for the individual, as well as for society as a whole, because, for example, they greatly facilitate police investigations, possibilities of abuse are endless. Sticking to the most beautiful memories becomes a modern form of addiction, missing the present because of living in the past, invading other people's privacy and intimacy, those are just some of them.Whether the positive aspects are worth the negative ones and how ethical and cost-effective this violation of privacy is, viewers have the opportunity to judge for themselves on the example of a couple whose marriage is falling apart, because the past no longer remains in the past, nothing falls into oblivion and time does not heal all wounds anymore.The premise is interesting, quite intimidating, and definitely calls for self-reflection. But, despite the good acting, the episode, compared to the previous ones, left a pale impression, because a strong premise was used for a relatively weak or maybe just insufficiently elaborated story. The potential of this idea could have been much better exploited.7/10."
1,3, Season One,7.0,"The trouble with most anthology shows (especially those that deal with the future, mystery, or technology) is that eventually they get compared to The Twilight Zone and come up lacking. An impossible standard, of course, but one that exists to this day (just showing how far ahead of its time that show was).This first, three-episode season of Black Mirror tackles similar themes as Rod Serling's TZ, only focusing on technology-based themes of this modern era. The themes of this season include:-A prime minister effectively blackmailed into a horrendous act by terrorism and social media.
-A future in which humans are little more than ad-watching, avatar-updating, electricity-producing slaves, with the only escape being an Idol-like reality show.
-A couple who have brain implants allowing them to remember and review every life act...for better or worse.By and large, the themes of Black Mirror are interesting and relevant. I found the first two episodes (especially the second one) to be a bit tedious, but the third one is excellent. That's why I can only give this First Season a 3.5 star rating.Overall, though, this proved to be an interesting enough concept for me to want to continue. I really enjoy television that makes me think, and that is the point of Black Mirror. I think (hope) the finale effort here marks a conscious effort to make sure the characters are as front-and-center as the concepts, which wasn't necessarily the case with the first two eps."
1,3, Keeping Memories Forever?,9.0,"A man goes through customs and shows his memories to prove he has done nothing criminal. He goes to a party and sees his wife chatting with Jonas. Jonas, a man who makes disgusting jokes about using his implanted device that holds his memories to look back at sexy times with women gives a bad impression on the man. The man suspects his wife has something for Jonas. He rewinds the night and sees how his wife smiles at Jonas but when faced to him the sparkle in her eyes are not there. His wife admits she had a 6-month relationship with Jonas previously. But she complains why are they digging up skeletons before their marriage. Everyone has skeletons she says even her husband with a woman she names. Later they have sex together that night.The man goes over to Jonas's and demands he deletes all footage of his wife. He does not want Jonas masturbating to his wife. However one detail catches his eye and he goes home to show his wife. He confronts his wife about a more recent video that took place in their bedroom. She claims it was nothing but the man demands she pulls up her memories. She tries to delete secretly but her husband is quick to catch on. Her husband asks her if the baby is his. She says yes. She admits Jonas and her had sex when they were in a week-long fight. Her husband asks if they used a condom and she says yes. He demands she pull up the recording and she does so.The husband is now in an empty house. Looks like he is no longer with his wife - she is his ex. He gouges out he memory implant."
1,3, Some memories are best forgotten,7.0,"If we ever needed proof that some technology is not of help.... this episode shows how keeping ALL your memories can ultimately unravel your life.From the very start we have the main character obsessing about his interview and literally playing it over and over gain, trying to guess what the interviewrs thought and if he did something wrong.After having joined his friends for dinner, he starts obsessing about his wife and one of the other guests. One may object that maybe this guy would obsess no matter what, but for sure having technological support to enable his addiction/weakness is not helping.Further investigation into his wife's past proves to be disastrous. Do one really need to know the truth at all costs?"
1,3, Devastating,9.0,Wow. This is a really really great episode of television. It's fairly simple yet extremely effective in the presentation and execution. Razor sharp.
1,3," Tragically sad, yet very engaging!",9.0,"The entire history of you plays with the concept that we all record everything that we see. We can replay any event and analyse it, display for others to see, relive our greatest moments! Sounds cool doesn't it?It isn't!It serves to breed paranoia, suspision, doubt, anger, hate, pain, and anguish!Brilliant invention that inevitably undermines the human condition and exposes its flaws.Thought-provoking and clever throughout, this episode is great!9/10"
1,3, Betrayal of love revealed thanks to constant life-recording technology,8.0,"Long ago, my young-teenage visits to my great aunt's house were enlivened by over-the-yard-wall quality time spent - increasingly enjoyably (and from my side increasingly romantically) with the girl next door. It was a somehow-remote place, and I long went without competition, grew blasé and stuck in the groove, if blissfully ""in control"" of what seemed an increasingly-fortuitous situation. Then one day, I went into the yard to find the said girl with 2 or 3 other guys older, wiser and (presumably) less boring and unadventurous than I. The girl found their company stimulating and hilarious, and all the more so when they turned their attention to mocking me. There was nowhere much to hide, and the loss of security and (exaggerated) sense of betrayal hurt terribly, and very soon generated a huge desire in me to hurt back ... which in practice I had zero capacity to do.Many a man who has allowed himself to soften through love, to let down his emotional guard and become dependent, has met this situation, and while women of course suffer when men are unfaithful to them, a man plagued by a powerful (and absurd) mix of territoriality, pride and self-doubting vulnerability can simply go to pieces in situations where a loved female decides for whatever reason (and often with surprising calculation) ""to spread it around"".If my above scenario was fortunate, it was in the fact that the revelation as to my inadequacy to hold on to someone I (believed I) cared about was quick and abrupt. This is not the case for The Entire History of You's Liam (played by Toby Kebbell) - a not-especially-sympathetic figure whose agony is nevertheless real and prolonged as he gradually realises how much he has been lied to by his ostensibly (and probably actually) loving wife (played very well by Jodie Whittaker), who nevertheless betrayed Liam with an old flame within hours of Liam's brief departure after a tiff. Wife Ffion does seem regretful, but to this day gives body-language and giggly clues that ""other guy"" Jonas remains ""forbidden fruit"" intriguing to her.And how does Liam see the evidence for this? And how does he come to dwell on this and little else? Because he replays and replays, slows down, stops and enlarges the ""footage"" recorded through his own eyes thanks to an implant called a grain. Raging, he also then accesses Jonas's recordings, and those of his wife, to gain a fuller and fuller picture.In a dinner-party context we are first given a few varied hint-insights into how a world in which such implanted grains are reasonably widespread works; but ultimately the implications are mainly considered in regard to the above love-triangle only. This is then an elemental juxtaposition of a story that is as old as the hills, and extremely familiar (even somewhat to myself in the above manner) with extreme high tech. It's also interesting that, in most other respects, the world we see here resembles ours (hence a touch of the ""Never Let Me Go"" scenario, whereby several areas of technological and cultural development are rather stuck in the doldrums, while one field has leapt forward beyond what we in the familiar world have accomplished).""The Entire History..."" is thus presented as an alternate reality, rather than especially the future.Obviously, this idea also gained exploration in ""The Final Cut"" (of 2004) with Robin Williams - a fine film that decided to consider the implications for far more serious crimes and misdemeanours than we get in this ""Black Mirror"" instalment not for once involving Charlie Brooker. While Liam does drink and look potentially violent and off-the-handle, his deployment of the technology is at this stage a desperate and anguished one as much as anything, and it raises the question as to whether some things might be best left unrecorded and hence unknown. But in the world of this episode, there is nowhere much to hide from what has been recorded, and the temptation to look back at unhelpful and self-hurting things proves just as great as the temptation to relive moments of life-changing importance or joy. Basically, Liam and his life fall apart rather rapidly.Is this actually the best or most-telling way of illustrating what a world operating on the basis of everything being recorded would be like?I'm not quite sure.But do we feel something as Liam faces the sick, cold, out-of-control realisation that a wife he idolises has let him down and is still only prepared to release information in snippets that mostly contradict what she has said before?Well of course we do - and it's both uncomfortable watching and (in fact typically for ""Black Mirror"") also rather profoundly sad."
1,3, Perfect memory,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.The third episode of Black Mirror concerns an upper class society with grain implants that allow them perfect memory they can play on a screen or on their eyes. The grain allows them to recall any part of their memory in perfect detail. The story in this episode concerns Liam Foxwell that has his jealousy of his wife's flirtations amplified by the grain technology.Similar to the previous two episodes in the season, The Entire History of You' sets up the world in the opening minutes. It even has a discussion about grains in the dinner party and its implications. The episode does a great job with setting the stage for the grain usageThe episode does not do that well in its depiction of Liam Foxwell's jealousy of Ffion Foxwell's flirtations with Jonas. It was obvious from the beginning that Liam's overly concerning nature would cause jealousy. That was not as exciting to watch as the ramifications of the grain's usage was. It was obvious that Liam's overly analytical nature would cause everything to be dug up.The episode does have good scenes in showing the destruction that the grains inadvertently cause. This is worth the price of watching the episode. I would recommend ""The Entire History of You"".Grade: BBlack Mirror Season OneBlack Mirror is an anthological television series that focuses on alternate presents, or near futures. The episodes are stand-alone and focus on science fiction concepts that talks about the a change in today's society or another dystopian future.The first season contains three episodes of about fifty minutes long. Each episode does not relate to one another. Each of the episodes have good production values. All of the episodes have different directors, and casts. The direction across all of the episodes is good with the mise en scene being well done to contribute to the story.The writing is the main draw in this series and season. The three episodes in the first season are drastically different from one another. The first episode focuses on the a a ransom with the most connection to contemporary society. The second episode's focus is on a dystopian society that uses merit points as currency. The third episode is a near-future where the inhabitants have recorded memories through an implanted device.I highly recommend the first season of Black Mirror. The season offers the same' thrills as the Twilight Zone in the past.Grade: A"
1,3, An astounding introduction into the mirror,10.0,"This was the 1st one i watched even if i kept on delaying my viewing pleasure until December 2018 😯 . It set a marker and to be fair many that follow still hit the spot.The 2nd time around is where you really notice that not only are these individual masterpieces that are set in different time zones , cities etc which btw are not mentioned so we never know exactly where we are, but all stories tend to link in one way or another so keep your eyes open and ears on full."
1,3, Most relatable thing i think ive ever seen,10.0,"EDIT: Even watching it for about 5th time still great and no change in stars.How many times have you been in that moment when you wish that you could show your other half what they said ?
How many times do you wish you could prove that you did remind them to let the cat out ?Or what about stuff at work ? University? Prove what the police officer said when he pulled you over ?But more important prove to your loved one that you are right.The grain gives humans this ability, yeah world problems solved ! Yes ?No ! Of course not ! What sounds perfect would be a complete head **** in reality.And throughout this episode you see our prototype tormented not blessed with the tech.A step to far. Indeed"
1,3, Brilliant and at times difficult and painful to watch,9.0,"Some people say that ""we are defined by our memories"" and that ""without memory we would lack any perspective"" with which to assess the world. Others say that ""memories are meant to fade."" and that ""time heals all wounds.""What if we lived in a world where memories literally own us and where they never, ever fade and are accessible in high definition and slow motion replay... Forever to anyone?
What if they could be stored and digitised... or even traded as a commodity?
What would memories become then?They would become our most prized possessions: More irreplaceable than hand-crafted treasures, more valuable than any diamond or gold. Imagine, our very essence and experiences captured (and with liberal editing) all the best parts distilled into a narcotic, addictive stream of consciousness, on tap wherever and whenever we desire.We could go back, time and time again to revisit out best experiences. We could show these details at will to others on any available screen. Alternatively, we could expunge forever that which we never wish to see again, and be forever distrusted as someone with no proof of what they've done or where they've been...Or, we could even keep those most painful moments it as a lash with which to whip ourselves while saying a dozen Hail Marys.This is the story of a family that live in such a world, where things once experienced can be recorded forever and used to wager a strategic, rightful war on those around us. But at what cost to ourselves and our relationships?"
1,3, Never Forget,9.0,"I always wondered what if our memories are saved or viewed? Finally, an episode about this.In the future, forgetting is not on the dictionary. They're recorded somehow and you can view it anytime, anywhere. Fantastic as it may seem, it has consequences.Really great episode and love the drama and all."
1,3, Relatable,10.0,"Very plausible and futuristic approach. Not as in aspiring term, but in actual realistic way we behave currently as well."
1,3, Grains and re-dos are more trouble than they're worth,10.0,"This Black Mirror episode was released in 2011, at the cusp of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. mania, so at the time, the technology depicted in this episode did still feel a bit distant and futuristic. Five years later in 2016 was when I actually stumbled upon this series. Watching ""The Entire History of You"" for the first time, I was very impressed yet still somewhat shrugged it off as another sci-fi fear mongering. Well now, another five years later, in 2021, I watched the episode again and was blown away by this masterpiece. The future depicted ten years ago is fast approaching now. Given the choice, the average person now is likely to sign up to have that ""grain"" installed in a heartbeat. It's a much more convenient way of capturing their lives the way they obsessively record everything now on all social media platforms. Privacy is out the window. This accelerated embrace of technology neglects the spontaneity of life and the natural human limitations designed keep our brains sane and functional. Some memories are meant to fade, and life's mundane events are not meant to be recalled play-by-play. Most of all, cherish the idea that today, the thoughts in your mind are still 100% yours. You think what you think, and nobody can force you to play a re-do of it. The way things are going though, it's probably only a matter of time when your thoughts can be put on a show for everyone to watch. And therein lies the true horror."
1,3, Wonderful Representation of Near Future.,8.0,"Nothing will Hide in the near future.
Basically I personally liked this concept of recording every single things which comes in front of our eyes.
I was wondered about this idea since I was a child.
Ha ha Jokes apart.
This technology is great to adapt but but but this can cause lots of damage in our relationship... Yeah you heard it right dude.. In this 21st century we've already watched lots of complications in couples relationship whether they married or not, but if this technology came anyhow in near future what will gonna happen, it's a clear example with this episode..Simply 8 Stars from my side."
1,3, Classical trope mixed with relevant issues,7.0,"Classical story about infidelity with problematic technology on top. Blurring of lines of online and offline life, devalvation of relationships and social skills, chips, infiltration of privacy in order to enforce security, inability to let the past go... All these problems are happening even today, this episode just pushes this phenomenon (quite) a bit further."
2,4, You might think you'd love to have your dead loved ones back....,7.0,"When the show begins, Martha and Ash seem to have a lovely life and the couple are clearly in love. However, after Ash leaves and fails to return, she soon learns the worst...he was killed in an accident. Martha is inconsolable but a pushy friend insists that she knows something that can help Martha work through her grief. Martha is NOT interested but after receiving a strange email, she investigates and learns that this same friend signed her up for a most unusual service...one that recreates your loved one based on their Facebook posts, emails and videos. Soon, Ash is alive...or at least a computer simulation of him. But there's far more to it than that...
Like almost every episode of ""Black Mirror"", this show examines current and near future technological advances and trends and tries to predict the dark side of their use. Very clever and well worth see, but I am deducting a point because the show did something I HATE and which is sadly too common...a closeup of a person barfing. Ugghhh...we don't need that."
2,4, Too Many Issues,7.0,"The premise to this was interesting. When a woman's husband dies, she goes into the deepest of depressions. A friend puts her onto a website which takes all his internet interactions and recreates him. Of course, it is limited to the data available. So one day, she takes the next step which is to buy, at great expense, a model of him that has the same gifts. She is excited at first but then begins to realize how sick this all is. What can she do. The possibilities are just to complex and she must take a dramatic turn."
2,4, Appearance vs. Individuality,7.0,"The youths Martha (Hayley Atwell) and Ash (Domhnall Gleeson) are deeply in love with each other and move in together to a house in the countryside. On the next morning, Ash drives the van they hired for the relocation back to the rental, but he has an accident and dies. During the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah (Sinead Matthews) tells her about a service to help grieving people to recover, creating a virtual Ash to communicate with her from the information available in social networks and Internet. Martha cries to Sarah and does not accept the idea. However, Sarah subscribes Martha to the service and she receives and e- mail from Ash and has an argument with Sarah. A few days later, Martha learns that she is pregnant and she does not succeed in contacting her sister Naomi (Claire Keelan). She responds Ash's e-mail and they start a relationship through e-mail first and through cell phone later. One day, Ash offers an experimental and expensive service to Martha and she receives a synthetic body identical to Ash. When Martha activates the clone, she finds an identical Ash and they have sex. Will she replace Ash by the clone?""Be Right Back"" is an interesting show of ""Black Mirror', with a story about appearance and individuality and scary application of artificial intelligence. The concept of using robots or clones to replace the partner is not original (see ""Cherry 2000"", for example), but ""Be Right Back"" shows much more. For example, the quantity of information about a person available in the social networks and internet that is sufficient to trace not only a profile, but also a shape. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not available"
2,4, Very moving. Very good episode.,8.0,"Hayley Atwell shines through in this thoroughly moving, heart wrenching tale of love and grief. Brooker proves that he can tug at the heart strings as well as entertain, as he takes you on a journey of tragedy and longing. The scary thing about this episode is I believe one day they'll have the technology to have something similar to the voice activated thoughts and conversations of someone deceased.I love the futuristic touches, such as the desktop and the car, really nice glimpses into a possible future.It's not an episode I'd be inclined to watch over, like San Junipero or Hang the DJ, but it serves as a really engaging, moving piece."
2,4," ""I wish I was there with you now.""",8.0,"It's interesting to see how television programs and movies keep pace with technology. Back in 1961, when the most advanced form of person to person communication relied on a dial telephone, the Twilight Zone episode 'Long Distance Call' had a recently departed grandmother talk to her grandson via a toy phone she gave him before she passed on. That story had a sinister element, in that the grandmother tried to talk the boy into joining her on the other side via suicide. Rod Serling recycled that theme later on in a fifth season episode titled 'Night Call', another venture into the nether regions between reality and the supernatural.There were so many ways this story could have gone, and after Martha (Hayley Atwell) took the step of bringing Ash (Domnhall Gleeson) back to some semblance of 'resurrection', I thought she might have gone the suicide route to put her on the same plane of existence as her former boyfriend. Her pregnancy obviated that idea, but I'm wondering why she would not have been creeped out by the whole idea of a dead person 'coming back to life'. Sure there was that initial reaction of shock, but I'm not so sure eventual acceptance would have led to having sex with a faux Ash. So chalk one up for the developing sexbot industry here. If I had to guess, since I haven't seen all the Black Mirror episodes yet, there's probably one dealing with that subject as well. Or there will be."
2,4, Very mature and moving,8.0,"Hayley Atwell and Domhnall Gleeson are superb and sublime in this season 2 episode of Black Mirror. It's very emotional, and demonstrates Charlie Brooker's enormous range in writing. I'm surprised this doesn't have more iMDB votes and user reviews. Still, definitely worth watching. Rod Serling would be proud for sure."
2,4, Define online.,7.0,"'Be Right Back (2013)' is the first entry in the second series of 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. Despite continuing the series' trend of exploring what happens when we push technology to the max, the piece is a decidedly character-focused affair. The central sci-fi premise almost doesn't matter; the thing is, first and foremost, an exploration of grief. It sets up an incredibly realistic, somewhat unconventional romance (in that it looks nothing like most Hollywood love affairs) and devastatingly wrenches it from you without any real flair. One minute, it's there; the next, it's not. The film works really well, balancing its existential questions with its beat-by-beat plot. It's well-written, considered and compelling. It has a unique premise and solid execution. 7/10"
2,4, 8,8.0,Well as the beginning of second season it wasn't as good as first start but the ending was creepier than I though so it earns extra point from me.
2,4," ""Imagine if it would have ended with the second-to-last scene.""",7.0,"In a car accident, a young woman loses her fiancé, a heavy addict to the Internet and social networks. This loss leaves her broken, especially when she realizes that she is pregnant. At the funeral, she learns about the software which, if it is given access to the deceased's internet accounts, can quite convincingly imitate him and thus enable the illusion of a conversation with a loved one. Although the idea was initially repulsive, when she tried the software, she quickly got hooked and distanced herself from the outside world. And then, after a while, she went one step further ...Although the episode eventually enters a serious SF, the initial premise is not far from our current reality, so it is easy to identify with this story. Additional strength is given by the excellent performance of Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter from Marvel movies and series). Her partner Domhnall Gleeson is also good, although this role does not give him too much space to show off.The story and atmosphere at first irresistibly reminded me of the movie ""Her"" (which, admittedly, was made later), which is definitely a plus for me, but later the episode loses its persuasiveness, which culminates in the last scene that unnecessarily spoils the overall impression.7/10."
2,4, Robot Lover,8.0,Martha and her husband are a beautiful couple. Their GPS is super cool. They have sex that night.Martha's husband passed away after taking the truck back to the rental. It is not explained how died. A woman suggests communicating with a cloud that can replicate her husband by taking everything associated with him technically.Martha is told by the cloud about an option that is not cheap. She gets a big package and opens it. It is a plastic body. She puts it in the bath and puts in electrolytes. The robot comes alive.Martha touches his face and takes off her top. She places his hand on her tit and he has no sexual response. She squeezes his penis and he replies he can turn that on and off automatically. So they end up having sex. Martha asks how did he learn all these moves and he says through porn.Martha eventually comes to the realization after her sister comes to visit that he will never truly replace her husband. She takes him to a cliff and orders him to jump.Fast forward and she has a daughter. The robot is kept in the attic and the daughter brings her cake up.
2,4, Creepy and disturbing,6.0,"Most of us have issues dealing with grief. The point everybody agrees about is that there are no shortcuts and that we need time to ""move on"".But what if technology would give us a chance to stay were we are? I can see lots of morbid developments, of which this episode is a chilling example.Freshly widowed Martha discovers she is pregnant and she is desperate to communicate the news to her deceased partner, Ash. A new ""service"" allows her to create an account based on Ash's presence on social media. Martha can now ""phone"" Ash and talk to him.Some additional - creepy - technology allows her to create a copy of Ash, but guess what? A replica is not like the real thing and Martha realises a bit too late that she is stuck with something that looks like Ash, but is not quite the same.So, when is it time to let go, if you can hold on forever?"
2,4, Good but not perfect!,8.0,"Be right Back is a great concept, but there was something missing that I am struggling to put into words here?Don't get me wrong, it is a good episode that realistically toys with a very chilling concept that, in part, may be somewhere in our future (Scary thought!)I think the first two thirds of this story played out better than the final third, maybe it went a little too far and became less scary rather than terrifying!As much as I enjoyed this, I was left wanting a little more.8/10"
2,4," More-conventional, minimalist, instalment, but certainly relevant/important",9.0,"""Be Right Back"" contrasts with its predecessors in looking more accessible from our standpoint (and hence more realistically threatening), if still presumably an alternative reality, since car technology that we have now here contrasts with higher tech - including the one that allows a dead person to be recreated on-screen or as a voice - on the basis of their online presence, phone calls, etc., and ultimately even moulded into corporeal form if a customer so wishes.Hayley Atwell as Martha does so wish, and is quite delightfully corporeal; and viewers like myself may be judgmental (jealous!) enough to regard as her a bit too hot for Domhnall Gleeson's Ash. But she's devoted to him anyway, and so is heartbroken when he takes the car out (from the inherited childhood home of his they are now residing in?) and never returns.And it's not academic in plot terms that the recreated version of Ash proves a FAR better lover physically for Martha than his flesh-and-blood predecessor. This is is the naughtiest moment of an episode suffused with an indefinable but tangible eroticism, and Martha's initial need for any contact having faced such sudden loss rather rapidly gives way to a need for physicality - satisfying for her even as it rapidly makes her aware that this is NOT the real Ash!The disparities only multiply (as of course they would) as time passes, and the stress of ""having"" but ""not having"" reaches a crescendo quite rapidly at Beachy Head or somewhere similar! A wonderfully dramatic and poignant moment that easily could have gone one of several ways.That that moment dissipates in the way it does proves powerful stuff, and leaves it abundantly - remarkably - clear that Martha has regained control of the situation, accommodated to it, and done something that offers far more for her and her daughter than it offers ""Ash"".Martha is therefore first bereaved and definitely the victim, and we out here can't help feeling that Ash's geeky absent-mindedness might somewhere down the line have contributed to her being in that situation. She then goes through various stages of disgust, outrage, utilisation, advantage-taking, disillusionment, anger, disgust again, accommodation and possibly exploitation. It's a roller-coaster therefore, but also one harking back to other films we've seen in which ""android rights"" can be trampled on as we see fit. Android Ash did not ask to be created, creeped Martha out in spite of everything, yet ended up with a confined shadow existence because - in the end - that was the best she could (or chose to) (or felt compelled to) offer him.Maybe ""he"" cares not, or maybe he does? And maybe the ""real"" Ash is up there in heaven wondering how he had so little to say about his ""re-creation""?If you're thinking from this description that Hayley Atwell runs this show, that's probably correct. But if you're thinking that means that Domhnall Gleeson does little, that's wrong. His acting in the ""dual"" roles is in fact fine and nuanced indeed.Overall, another EXTREMELY thought-provoking - if indeed ""dark"" - setup.Well done!"
2,4," Pretty Generic, Yet Pretty Neat!",7.0,"Familiar yet interesting concept. Superbly executed with a top-notch direction, and superb acting, especially from Hayley Atwell. But the plot is infuriatingly formulaic. if Hayley Atwell didn't deliver such a powerhouse performance, I wouldn't have sympathized even a little bit with the protagonist. Everything seems like I've seen hundred times before, and everything is so predictable, except the ending which isn't great but at least unpredictable. Also, like some other Black Mirror episodes, Be Right Back presented and displayed its idea in a very simple and direct way that doesn't fit with such a top-quality series.(7.5/10)"
2,4, Tragedy and mimicry,8.0,"This review contains for the first episode of the second season of Black Mirror entitled ""Be Right Back"".After a tragic accident affects a couple, the surviving woman deals with grief. An experimental online service allows spouses and loved ones to communicate with the deceased. This is accomplished through the online service learning about the deceased person through chats and social media. Eventually Martha, the grieving widow commits more of Ash, the deceased, for the service's database.The first episode of the second season is incredibly strong. This episode encapsulates a lot of what makes Black Mirror great. The technology could happen in the near future and present this scenario. All of the actors in this episode do a phenomenal job. Haylee Atwell deserves praise for her great performance as Martha. The cross-section between Black Mirror's exploration of technology and human drama is what makes the show good.The theme of an imitation is well executed in this episode. From the beginning of the resurrected Ash communicating to Martha, the interaction mimicked reality with portions of it being off. This is only accelerated when more information is fed into the new Ash. Even when Ash regains a body, the interactions felt like an imitation. It was not real and was stuck in the past. Nothing new could develop from the relationship. This part of the story spoke to me and how it can be interpreted as a commentary on the current times.I highly recommend ""Be Right Back"". this episode marks a good start to the second season of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
2,4, Wow ! Creepy even for the mirror,7.0,"How far would you go to have your dearly departed back in your life?This episode actually plays along with a notion that seems visible at first , taking all of ones social media input , emails , texts etc and becoming a virtual self answering questions and talking to you as the one you know.Even when voice is included its something that could be a thing of the future, but then to put a naked none sex whatever into a bath of ice and hey presto the body is back balls n all with a none stop libido.A little spooky.A great episode spoiled by its ending , it just doesn't add up that the daughter keeps it secret and the none human version goes along and says nothing about being dad.Nah needs a different conclusion. But maybe my ( black mirror final showdown theory) will explain why"
2,4, Splits opinions. Everyone as one,7.0,"Ive seen sites where this comes out No1 in black mirror fave episodes. Thats the problem when you dont hold a ballot.Its just not my cup of tea, great idea in principle but could have been used much different. Some great one scenes however."
2,4, Liked it but not loved it.,9.0,"I think the problem was in the ending that was not clear. I don't think episode showed any black side of technology though the protagonist thought it was not as she expected but from my point of view it was the best technology can do, after all it is just technology not a human with perfect mind. So according to me in this episode only white side of technology was shown, though the protagonist always focussed on showing it bad, nothing else."
2,4, Simulcra and Simulation,8.0,"At what point do we step over the ""uncanny valley"" and into a simulation of something so real that, even for a brief moment, we convince ourself that it is real?In this episode, what technology takes away from us when we are living: our concentration and focus on the here and now, it attempts to reinstate when we are dead, all those lost opportunities and moments spent in the virtual world are returned, with interest.Only what comes back is merely a simulacrum, a reflection of what once was, and when the grief is over and one opens one's eyes again, one realises the shallowness of that before them and any previous feeling of intimacy and thankfulness is quickly soured into resentment and anger.IS there a difference between life itself and a simulation, thereof? And if a simulation were of sufficient complexity and sophistication, would it become indistinguishable from life itself?"
2,4, Very Emotional,10.0,"How far can technology take us? As far as, say, talking to a long-dead loved one on the phone, and even creating another physical version of him or her? Creepy, but the main character on this story did those. This episode is really unsettling...and also very emotional and powerful. The acting by the main character is simply fantastic. Best episode since the pilot."
2,4, first good one in two seasons,9.0,"I am watching them out of order. and thing ppl value at 8 shoks me. this one was actually high level all the way. strong script, acting, ark, originality. all there"
2,4, Very insightful and thought provoking,8.0,"I saw this after reading about the plot online, and this episode didn't disappoint. The old saying ""Be careful what you wish for, you might get it"" is apt here.Martha's grief is very real and it seems it never goes away even after the synthetic Ash appears and does her bidding. Yes, we miss the great things about our partners but also the not-so-great things. That was a good point. Still, for Martha to want the synthetic Ash to jump off a cliff was a bit much, even if he was a machine. At least she had some part of him that she could keep, esp. with their child on the way. I mean if my wife died and such, I wouldn't mind an android to remind me and my child of what she was like, even if I'd moved on.Highly recommended."
2,4, This Intimacy between Humans & Machines Can't be Possible ; yet a Magnificent Concept! 😍,9.0,"Sometimes Impossible things became possible with the help of advance Technology. But are they long lasting?
It's answer is briefly present here inside this Episode.This episode have something which we really wanna get, especially for our beloved family members! Whom we miss so much after their demise.
But after the fulfillment of our this impossible dream, it also gives us some dark side of this amazing concept.
Ha ha I know You're confusing after hearing so many Ifs'/Buts' here in my review, but trust me watch it for once you'll understand what I'm saying.I'm Going with 9 Out of 10 Stars for this Wonderful Concept. I mean Ohh wow, they just made it perfectly. You can't watch it with family members though because of some intimacy scenes between leading characters."
2,5, Making the punishment fit the crime...,6.0,"A young woman awakens to find herself totally confused. She can't remember who she is and is amazed to see people chasing after her with weapons and they are trying to kill her. To make it all very surreal, there are LOTS of other people standing about with their smartphones videotaping the procedings. It seems that she's the prey in some strange game and the results are deadly. But what does it all mean??As usual, this episode of ""Black Mirror"" looks at modern technology and possible technology of the near future to propose how it might be abused. In this case, a woman is being horribly tormented and chased in something that is reminiscent of ""The Jerry Springer Show"" and a hunting show! Very thought provoking, I am a bit reticent to strongly recommend it because it becomes almost like torture porn watching the show. A bit too disturbing and vivid for many."
2,5, Cruel and Unusual Punishment,7.0,"A frightened young woman finds herself running for her life. It would seem that everyone has gone mad and do nothing to help her in her escape. She is shot at, beaten up, attacked, threatened with a kind of crucifixion. It would seem that she is the murderer of child and her hoped for escape is part of her punishment. I won't go into too many details other than to say that her punishment is wrong. Since she has no memory of her crime, to keep putting her through all this over and over makes no sense. I know the idea is to make her feel what the child felt, but her memory has been scrubbed. This is a cheap trick that shows like the Outer Limits already did a couple times."
2,5, Punishment online,8.0,"Victoria Skillane (Lenora Crichlow) awakes dazed and confused on a chair in front of a television with a weird sign, pills spilled on the floor and bandage around her wrists. She walks around the house with amnesia and glimpses of a girl. She sees a picture of her, a man and the girl on a fireplace and she concludes she might be her daughter. She leaves the house and sees people watching and filming her passively. Out of the blue, a man with a rifle hunts her down and she runs under the view of the inhabitants. She meets a young woman called Jem (Tuppence Middleton) that explains to her that most of the population is controlled by a signal from the White Bear transmitted that transforms them into voyeurs. They run to a convenience store in a gas station and the hunter shots and kills Jem's friend Damien (Ian Bonar). They run to escape and a man called Baxter (Michael Smiley) stops a van and saves them from hunters. But the guy is a sadistic hunter but they succeed to flee. Jem explains that she intends to burn the White Bear to the ground and they drive to the facility. When they reach the place, Victoria learns secrets about her and the place where nothing is what seems to be.""White Bear"" is a film with a cruel and dark story of punishment online with a surprising plot point in the end. The truth about Victoria is absolutely unexpected. The story has criticism to the present lifestyle, with people not interacting with the others and passively watching the world through the screens. Further the population maybe tired of the present injustices in the legal system has created the perfect punishment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not available."
2,5," Twisted, clever, one of the best.",9.0,"White Bear is another superb episode of Black Mirror, definitely one of the best of the early seasons. Lenora Crichlow is terrific as the main character, and her bizarre scenario is terrifically exciting and enthralling. The twist is huge, and delivered in such a way, that you lose all empathy for the 'victim.' it's a very visual episode, it looks incrediy stylish, the story is such, that it stays with you, it certainly gets you wondering.One of the best. 9/10"
2,5," ""Throw her back to where she came from.""",8.0,"The guy who really deserved the White Bear Justice Park treatment was Victoria Skillane's (Lenora Crichlow) boyfriend, but he was already dead due to the crime the couple perpetrated. This is an episode that really keeps you guessing until the major reveal near the end with the studio audience and the 'actors' taking their bows. There will be those viewers who are repulsed by the story's repetitive punishment for the kidnapping crime, while others will sense a fitting justification for keeping Victoria on an endless treadmill. I'm kind of torn on this one, but I have to admit the execution was excellently done. Lenora Crichlow was superb in her role as the brain addled Victoria and the relentless pace of the chase to capture her doesn't let up for much of a breather. The tease with the masks and costumes make the ones giving chase appear to be the bad guys, but when that's turned on it's head, the result is as surprising to the viewer as it is to Ms. Skillane. Watching 'Black Mirror' in order, this one came across as the most surreal so far, if not the most thought provoking. It would seem to be a hard one to top."
2,5, Very good... Just not as great as I wish it was,8.0,"This has its share of intense beats, and the climax pays off. But I didn't gravitate to it like other parts of series 1, 2 and 3. The big twist (and it's one that is major) helps to give everything that happens more sense, and maybe I woukd find more a second go around. I just question so many resources being used against one person, regardless of the severity of the crime. Maybe if there was a follow up episode where they show the political debate about using tax dollars for such a thing as a ""Criminal Park"". So in other words it is effective but it only works with the reveal (maybe as just a nightmare it would be a real wallop). Or, on top of this, I can't help but think back to seeing this done with far tighter and harrowing execution inn Watkins's Punishment Park in the early 70s - the concept here isn't far off, only no cell phones and it was more up front with the concept. I do like that the 'host' is one of those ""oh, THAT Ben Wheatley character actor!"
2,5, Twist in the tale,8.0,"I never saw the twist in the tale of this fine episode of Black MIrror. Much has been written about this seminal episode from the mind of Charlie Brooker. I'm especially impressed by the English gloomy skies, which add more than a touch of realism to this harrowing episode where we are desperate to make sense of the horror. What is the white bear? We soon find out."
2,5, Intolerable cruelty.,7.0,"The second series of 'Black Mirror (2011-)' continues with 'White Bear', which is perhaps the most 'twist-reliant' episode so far. In fact, it's the only episode of the first two seasons to pivot entirely on a single, central reveal. That's not to say it's bad, though. The plot point in question does reshape the rest of the piece, while also opening a discussion around several interesting themes. When is a punishment considered a crime? Can you be held responsible for something you have no recollection of? How far is too far? These questions are incredibly intriguing and the picture does an excellent job of posing them without even really attempting to answer them. It's thematically compelling and often uncomfortable, its devilishly dark and near nihilistic outlook never once relenting. The bulk of the movie is taken up by a more straightforward survival story, though. It's chock full of mysteries and doesn't really come into itself until its final third. It's always enjoyable, though. It may not be the best 'Black Mirror (2011-)', but it's still a solid piece of science-fiction. 7/10"
2,5, 9,9.0,"That's definitely very brutal punishment at first I though that this episode is going to be very basic and simple but the ending surprised me. Very nice, almost perfect."
2,5, Satire of hypocrisy,8.0,"A young woman wakes up from unconsciousness with complete amnesia. Not knowing who she is or where she is, she begins to wander around and it becomes increasingly clear to her that something is seriously wrong. All the people she encounters stare at her in complete silence and record her with mobile phones, keeping a safe distance at all times. And then masked lunatics begin to appear, trying in every way to get to her, completely ignoring the silent observers.Almost everything I want to comment on this episode would spoil it to those who have not seen it yet. The series has gone a step further and sci-fi drama, that characterized the previous episodes, here is brought to the brink of horror. A mysterious story, good acting and even better directing build a creepy and tense atmosphere, which culminates in a completely unexpected twist. All sorts of theories went through my head, but at no point was I even close to grasping what it was all about. Original and very effective.8/10."
2,5, What is justice?,7.0,"As most other episodes of Black Mirror, this one raised difficult questions through uncomfortable viewing. That is why I would not feel honest to write that I ""liked"" it - as in ""it was fun, I'd like to watch it again"".I would not want to watch this again, but for sure it made me think about punishment that fits the crime. Nowadays, lots of people feel that criminals literally get away with murder and that punishment for heinous crimes is too light.To which extent particularly cruel crimes should be punished? The extent showed in this episode seems OK, up to the point of repetition. How many times is the criminal supposed to go through the same torture? Is ten years of suffering enough to pay for a week of criminal activity? And who establishes how long the punishment must last?Uncomfortable food for thought."
2,5, Cruel and unusual punishment,8.0,Another episode that highlights a flaw about humanity that has always existed. We must be entertained.
2,5, This episode doesn't hang about!,9.0,"Black Mirror episodes often set a scene and take some time to lure you in and immerse you in the characters before frying your brain with a clever twist or a thought-provoking idea!White Bear is straight in there, right from the off it's a hard hitting, fast ride, littered with tension, mystery and excitment.There's a powerful message in this one and it's executed brilliantly come the reveal at the end!Quality 9/10"
2,5," Only Torture Drama, No Si Fi nor Thriller",2.0,"I was expecting it should be a good science fiction with thriller but lastly found only torture drama, which made me very irritated at last 10 minutes. To say truly I could not see such torture again and again. What to say writer & director ? Torture is never enjoyable at all. Ratings 10,9 or 8 are not understandable to me. A request to writer and director not to show such horrifying episodes.In my personal opinion story is going well till first half and then writer did not understand what is proceed further, so he turned story to an awful way, which is totally different from original story and would be unbelievable. Otherwise story may be meaningful at the end."
2,5, Chilling!,8.0,"This episode of Black Mirror, entitled WHITE BEAR, confounds me. I circled around wondering where and how to rank it in the series. The only thing I know for certain is that Lenora Crichlow (as the episode protagonist Victoria Skillane) delivers arguably the greatest performance of the entire series, a completely immersive, lived-in piece of acting. How in the hell did this woman not win an award for this emotionally powerful masterpiece of acting? Her acting alone makes the episode worth watching.Now to the content of the episode. I was a little bit annoyed by all the people running around with their cell phones, which kind of took me out of the experience at times. Also, I didn't much care for the supporting characters. I was so transfixed by Skillane's character, everyone and everything else felt second fiddle. And by the end of it all, I still didn't very much care about any character's involvement other than Skillane, although perhaps that was the intent. The dank, chilly setting was fitting for the downbeat nature of the episode and the ending was definitely shocking, but it was really Crichlow's fantastic acting that carried it all the way. The ending is very shocking, but the getting there can be annoying at times. But it's definitely one of the more interesting Black Mirror endings."
2,5, GIGANTIC hammer cracking smallish nut,7.0,"Make no mistake, this episode watched as it goes can readily seem a candidate for the scariest and most disturbing thing shown on British TV in recent times. It's quite graphic and very disorientating, and psychologically disturbing.And then we get the punchline, and kind of track back to what we've been seeing; and it's hard not to see what has gone before as somehow gratuitous and manipulative.Hyperbole at least has been deployed big-timeThat said, the core idea of people's punishment becoming a form of mass entertainment is not so far off the mark (from history too, of course). And likewise the idea that we might want to utterly humiliate, abuse and remove all rights from those found guilty of heinous crimes. This is ironic given the fact that lead character Victoria (an effective Leonora Crichlow) is someone we are conditioned to sympathise with when her plight unfolds through the episode - as we think it is doing in some dystopian fashion; only to find at a given moment that we had NO INSIGHT INTO THE REALITY WHATSOEVER.This is an original and shocking approach, but the episode's volte-face is so wrong-footing that we don't fully adjust to the new reality in the time allowed for that, and so we actually get a bit less from the work than we might.The point being made is strong and interesting anyway, but we are entitled to ask if the overall take of the episode is actually condemnatory enough..."
2,5, Over punishment,8.0,"This review contains spoilers for the second episode of the second season of Black Mirror entitled ""White Bear"".The episode opens with a woman waking from amnesia. In the house, a strange symbol is shown on the television screens. After exiting the house, she finds people recording her and offering no assistance. The episode follows this episode as she tries to survive the apocalyptic situation.This episode contains a twist that does the earlier runtime make more sense. The plot is absolutely engrossing from the beginning to the end, the plot follows the woman as she tries to survive. The world is fun to learn about as the entire situation seemed impossible.The movie does episode does have a great pace and the twist of realizing the theme park is awesome. This was where the commentary on society goes into full swing like other episodes of Black Mirror. It is a great commentary for how the media desensitizes the public's behaviors. It is not far-fetched to believe that the the public in today's world could accept the society in ""White Bear"".I highly recommend the second episode of the second season of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
2,5, make no sense,2.0,"another reviewer had it right that there's too much going on in this episode, to the point that, sticking with one theme makes it a painfully blunt, semi-clever take on the ""bystander effect"". Sticking with the other (as it eventually did) makes it not make sense.the idea of wiping a criminal's memory and then punishing their new ""personality"" is a subject handled much better in a show like Babylon 5 with Brad Douriff playing a priest traumatized by nightmares of murder, to which it's revealed he used to be a serial killer who was basically ""repurposed"" as a useful member of society.here, the criminal's memory is wiped, then they're punished with an elaborate nonsensical scenario that has absolutely nothing to do with the nature of their crime, then at the very end everything is revealed to them and they're given a ""walk of shame"" moment while basically completely oblivious as to what the hell just happened.personally the concept of ""punishing"" a criminal by wiping their memory and then punishing them is immoral and nonsensical, as by wiping their memory you've essentially created a whole new person, and you're now tormenting that person for the crimes of someone else. Even leaving that aside, the ""punishment"" makes no sense relative to the crime and by repeatedly wiping their memory and doing it all over again it completely defeats the purpose.but all of that is resolved in the mid-credits sequence of clips which show this is all basically an amusement park designed to make money off people paying to watch someone suffer in a post-apocalyptic hellscape then yell at them afterwards, adding a third, poorly executed moral theme about commercializing suffering or something that could've been done better"
2,5, OMG should i feel sorry or not ?,10.0,"Test your humanity
The poor girl , wakes , frightened, unsure and disoriented. Asking for help , being chased by a crazy man with a shot gun whilst passer bys take photos and film on phones. As the craziest of situations continues her life is put at risk multiple times when all of a sudden.Crack!Black Mirror of course and one of the most head thumping twists as you now thinking does she deserve it, how bad are we for thinking this way.Why do you do this Brooker?"
2,5, Unalloyed irony and hypocrisy,8.0,"Funny how these two words don't seem to come up, at least in the comments and reviews I have read, yet they're what this episode is all about. Irony and hypocrisy.Without wanting to say too much, although I've flagged this comment as containing a spoiler (first time I've used this function), the denouement makes clear that the many dozens--hundreds even! --of people involved in this project, are guilty of quite cruel hypocrisy--they are engaging in precisely the behavior that they claim to be helping to punish--and are part of a spectacle that is as ironic as can be imagined.For this reason I've rated this episode fairly highly, although I don't believe the interests of verisimilitude have been served. I don't believe--and certainly don't want to believe-that any significant number of people could be so heartless, so utterly devoid of human empathy."
2,5, Oh. My. God,10.0,"That twist at the end was something..Sure I understand the complaint that this episode is just a woman screaming and running around for 40 minutes but it's the point. The episode put us in the shoes of Victoria, confused and scared of what is happening and in the end, one of the best plot twists ever happens."
2,5, Fatally Flawed,2.0,"Whoever wrote the script for this is an idiot. Okay, so the woman videoed her fiance killing a child. Yup, that is completely awful. However, when you wipe out someone's entire memory, you have changed the person. She no longer remembers the crime and is not any longer the person who did it.This episode takes a completely new person and subjects them to torture over and over again. It's not punishment because she has no knowledge of her crime. When a person cannot understand why they are being punished, the punishment is pointless. And no, showing her the video at the end does not solve this problem. It makes it worse. Because regardless, it is a different person.Beyond stupid and easily the worst Black Mirror."
2,5, A powerful message that will only be absorbed by a few.,8.0,"WHITE BEAR's plot does not stand up to intensive scrutiny or logical dissection, however the message behind it's premise is abundantly clear. But the message will only be recognized by those of us who haven't already descended into this hellish, jaded world. This episode seems to be taking crime and punishment to the extreme, but it isn't really about that.The episode accurately portrays us as being trained to treat world-wide tragedies as entertainment. After all, today's reporters jostle for space to film burned, shot and broken people to get the money shot of blood, tears, screams and destruction, while passers-by look on.Exceptional situations are no longer a prompt for action for most of us. A degradation of our morals allow us to watch and wait for someone else to fix the issue for us. It reminds me of the YouTube comments I read when someone uploads a car accident. The priority is on the way the camera is held rather than the upside down bus full of injured children.Why do we now reach for a camera rather than the first aid kit when a friend hurts themselves? What are we becoming? How far down this path will we go?All very interesting questions that came up for me after watching WHITE BEAR."
2,6, Sadly....I don't think we're very far from this at all.,9.0,"""Black Mirror"" is a British series that consisted of two episodes...until Netflix got involved and commissioned more episodes. This episode is one of the original ones.Waldo is an animated television character who is done LIVE using modern motion-capture technology. He is voiced by an out of work comedian, so you know the character is quick-witted. But he's also crude, offensive and annoying...yet the public seems to love Waldo and his offensive antics...so much that they decide to unleash him on a local election for Parliament. He pretty much makes a mockery of the election and despite how offensive and awful Waldo is the public love him. At this point...Waldo's voice starts to worry where all this is headed.This is a very prescient episode of ""Black Mirror"". I think it gauges the public and their sheep mentality quite accurately...especially in light of some of our recent elections. I don't want to make this a political rant...just see this clever and very insightful show."
2,6, Is This the Future,6.0,"Another dystopian venture. In this one, a cartoon bear named Waldo confronts the establishment politicians with obscene and acerbic comments. The guy who voices him is a two-bit comedian who simply howls insults, but catches on. There are times when the voters get a feeling of being disenfranchised and go for the lowest common denominator. We are currently in a period of populism, which usually mean the dumb, uninformed people are handed power. People who have no knowledge of infrastructure, human rights, or basic decency. The scariest thing is that these things have gone global. This episode also implies that there are forces who know how to manipulate all this craziness to destroy people who do good. I guess, there's so much cynicism here that the whole thing turned me off. Just too simplistic to work. But still we need to beware."
2,6, Searching for the New in Politics,7.0,"The comedian Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby) has created the blue cartoon bear Waldo and provides voice and movements to the character. Waldo is the host of a night show where he interviews politicians to humiliate them. When the conservative politician Liam Monroe (Tobias Menzies), who is the leader in the researches, is irritated by Waldo during a show, his producer Tamsin (Christina Chong) and the television owner Jack Napier (Jason Flemyng) decide to follow Monroe along his campaign to disturb him against Jamie's will. Waldo becomes popular and people decides to vote him to protest against politician. Meanwhile Jamie has one night stand with the Labour Party candidate Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie) and they fall in love with each other. However Gwendolyn is advised by the party adviser to keep distance from Jamie during the campaign since he might use inside information in his show. During a debate, Monroe uses the information he has about Jamie and offends him. Jamie has an anger outburst and attacks Monroe and Gwendolyn. What will be the consequences in the upcoming election?""The Waldo Moment"" is a ""Black Mirror"" show with a great idea – the search for the new in politics. A clown was recently elected congressman in Brazil with the largest number of votes in a clear demonstration of dissatisfaction of the Brazilian voters with the politicians. Waldo would be a similar case in the plot. However, director Bryn Higgins shows heavy hand and what could have been a great satire becomes a deep drama. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
2,6, Vote Waldo!,7.0,"Of all the episodes of Black Mirror that I've seen, this one seems the least far fetched, when you look at the state of The UK right now politically, this doesn't seem too far off, people are so detached politically right now, that I can believe in this.It doesn't have the depth of other episodes, when you consider that this followed White Bear in particular, it does lack any sort of shock factor, or any real emotional depth.The moment where Jamie attacks the MPs is great, he clearly doesn't handle rejection well.Politics in 2018, I could vote for a blue bear.As a political geek I enjoyed this one, and love its relevance, but I get that the appeal to this one is more limited. Daniel Rigby and Tobias Menzies are both terrific.Better then it's perceived. 7/10"
2,6," ""I'm the vote of a blue bear.""",5.0,"Episodes like this lose me when they get over the top obscene and vulgar like this one did. You don't have to be a prude to get turned off, but when it's relentless and unbalanced by an effective, opposing point of view, then I don't see any value in maintaining my interest. One can see however how things are generally trending this way in the life of our political discourse. Pretty soon, the candidates themselves will be throwing the 'F' word around and at each other during a prime time debate. To his credit, Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby), the voice of Waldo, wanted none of it when his producers put him in the running for an election to Parliament. Waldo's second place finish under the guidance of Jack (Jason Flemyng) seemed like a pretty good wake up call to a society that places more emphasis on crude celebrity than credible ideas on how to improve society."
2,6," Terrific, ruthless satire",10.0,"The Waldo Moment, one if the high points of the early Black Mirror series, captures what happens when animated and/or satirical things come up in popular life, including politics, especially in the UK (remember that nominee for PM who was literally like a black helmeted knight out of Monty Python, Lord whoever). We love cartoons because of the abstraction of it, that they can represent so much that we don't face when it is a regular flesh and blood person in front of us. Think of South Park and Family Guy, or as a human example Stephen Colbert back when he was Colbert of the Report. The Waldo Moment captures all of the mania that comes with a figure, a joke, a walking talking prank, getting the attention of a public who can be so easily galvanized. One may see Jason Flemyng as the cynical villain - a character out of Chayefsky's Network (this reminded me of that too). It might not have the twists of other Black Mirror parts, and if I have any real mark against it I almost wish it was longer than its usual 40 minute show length. But it tells its story with excellent conviction, and recent times have beared out (no pun intended.. Ok a little) what it is saying. It gets in and gets out and does even better what the first episode of this series tried to do with the PM and sex with a pig, which was a solid concept done somewhat typically."
2,6," Populist and populism, kind of foreshadowed...",8.0,"Charlie Booker has a knack for foreseeing trends, and The Waldo Moment seemed to presage the populist movements around the world...Greece, The Philippines, UK (Brexit) and of course the USA in particular the 2016 presidential election. It seems Charlie also foresaw accusations about a now former Prime Minister and student antics with a pig.Waldo is quite crude yet he gets much of the population to adore him. But Waldo is part of something bigger, a worldwide scheme that is more than a political campaign.One thing I didn't really get was that no-one dared to go behind the screen and wring their hands around the man behind Waldo!! Why not?"
2,6, Apolitical is political.,7.0,"'The Waldo Moment (2013)' seems to be one of the more polarising episodes of 'Black Mirror (2011-)'. Perhaps it released ahead of its time or perhaps it isn't overtly sci-fi enough. Personally, I think it fits in just fine with its peers. It has only gotten more relevant since its release, in a myriad of nearly impossible to predict ways. Once again, Brooker creates a bleak, thematically rich story that keeps its focus firmly on character. Though they aren't the most well-rounded in the show, the central figures of this story all feel like real people. Possibly the piece's best and most frightening aspect is the way in which its in-universe public react to the events they're experiencing. It hits close to home and has plenty to say. The same can be said of the entire affair. It's a solid, entertaining slice of low-key science-fiction. Honestly, I don't understand some of the apparent hesitation towards it; it's as much 'Black Mirror' as any other episode is. 7/10"
2,6, 5,5.0,"So the producers did great job for whole 35minutes with interesting plot of this episode and they've decided they're doing too well and make the ending miserable disappointment, really sad."
2,6, The weakest link,5.0,"Jamie is a mediocre comedian who lends his voice to the blue animated bear Waldo. Waldo is in the style of the ""South Park"" series, only at a much lower and more primitive level. During the election, the producers use Waldo to ridicule the candidates. The unexpectedly good reaction of the public leads them to put Waldo in the race. But Jamie is not material for a politician and snaps under pressure. In an attempt to destroy the campaign, he destroys his private life, while politics goes on, as if nothing had happened.The idea is good, especially because it is not far from reality, but the realization is poor, or perhaps, a better word is lazy. Political satire is lukewarm, and human drama does not arouse any emotions, both because of the weak script and because of the unimpressive acting.5/10."
2,6," This one appealled to me, although my wife found Waldo annoying lol!",9.0,"The Waldo Moment is a brilliant satirical look at the state of modern politics.This one isn't deep or even that clever, so far as Black Mirror episodes go. But it is very funny and actually quite tragic that it feels so true to life.The Politics, the society, and the media are all very accurately portrayed. And in the real world we all have to admit that Waldo would get votes, he may even win if he really did run for office!9/10 for it's sheer simplicity"
2,6," Not without some merit, but the series is losing its way here, by going too far...",5.0,"While the postscript is more crucial than the episode here (so don't press the stop button too soon!), a crude, foul-mouthed blue-coloured cartoon bear destructive of and tending to trivilalise political debate only has so much mileage in it, one would feel. Even though people might indeed cheer on such pricking of the pompous political bubble (as they did with ""Spitting Image"" in the 80s), it was - as the Conservative candidate says here, that oh-so-pompous and ostensibly-irrelevant party-political system ""that built the roads"" (this is actually the most worthwhile comment in the episode, even though it was most likely not meant to be!)And of course the British state also built hospitals and dispensed life-saving drugs and carried out operations too. And kept the peace and allowed many people who want to to make progress in their lives.So could this disrespectful blue character called Waldo really be used to promote dissent, encourage violence and revolt and give rise to a police state? Is today's image online and in other forms really so indestructable once created? Would attempts by states to eradicate the phenomenon only encourage its popularity, and drive it underground? Do (most) people really want to abandon conventional politics and replace it with nihilism?These are worthwhile questions, conceivably, but the episode only hints at them, deciding to stay mostly with the first emergence of the Waldo phenomenon; and for this viewer at least, the behaviour of the bear - with or without his original handler (played by Daniel Rigby) - actually makes a slightly slimy Conservative candidate look sensible, sympathetic and likeable (and he did win the election anyway); while encouraging fellow feeling for a rather hopeless female Labour Party candidate who always knew she had no chance of winning (that's actors Tobias Menzies and Chloe Pirrie, if anybody's especially bothered).While ""Black Mirror"" can be quite tremendously clever and thought-provoking, here - one believes - it is taking a vaguely sensible/conceivable premise and stretching it well beyond its limits. And the targeting is off, too, as the main condemnation here is not against a failed/failing conventional political system, but against people who can readily be encouraged into hooligan behaviour.So not much new there, really?Interestingly, Waldo's ultimate owner (played by Jason Flemyng) here does - in one sentence of dialogue - raise issues about sidestepping parliaments by going straight to the people online ... of a kind therefore very familiar to those who recall the 2017 Emma Watson/Tom Hanks vehicle ""The Circle"". While the latter film was weak by any standards, it considered the issue referred to quite effectively (at moments at least), while ""The Waldo Moment"" is entirely tangential to this genuine threat that DOES exist for democracy; preferring instead to go with a cartoon character crudely obsessed with its own phallus.Somehow we've slightly missed the target, haven't we?"
2,6, Anti-politics,6.0,"This review contains spoilers for the third episode of the second season of Black Mirror entitled ""The Waldo Moment.""The episode opens with the political season ramping up in the United Kingdom. Waldo, a cartoon bear controlled by Jamie Salter, interviews politicians and authority figures in a comedic way. Waldo is incredibly popular among the British public. During a brainstorming session, the people working with Waldo suggest entering the political race.The episode has a big links to political systems across the world. This episode is a good commentary on how a political system can fail a large portion of a population. Although this is one of the weaker episodes in the second season, the episode had as much if not more to say in its plot and themes. The Waldo Moment presented a theory that the public could be motivated to choose a candidate that stands for nothing. This choice can be reflected by elections recently where many voters feel alienated and disenfranchised by the choices that are presented to them. Waldo is simply a conglomeration of these voters.I would recommend ""The Waldo Moment"".Grade: B"
2,6, Who painted my mirror ?,7.0,"This is a funny , tragic and interesting tale of a guy whos career as tumbled to rock bottom. However he has one saving grace a cartoon based character he lends his voice too. However now that looks to be in danger he needs a new idea and quick.Main flaw , its nkt black mirror imho however i have a feeling that when the last black is cast every episode will marry up so maybe im missing somethingA wobbly 6"
2,6, Like an extended newswipe clip ( Charlie Brooker UK show ),7.0,"I think Charlie got his shows confused , although the plot significantly points out how you can end up with a President Trump this is in the main a comedy, a look at British politics, and the rise of populism.Its a good one of show but not very black mirror."
2,6, Not as great as the others,7.0,"This is a good episode, but not as fantastic as the others. It's the weakest episode by far. The story is about a failed comedian who voices a comedic cartoon named Waldo. It is a political satire. The acting is great but the story lacks something."
2,6, Captures election back stage manipulation perfectly.,8.0,"This episode was dragging along a bit, only holding my partial interest - until the meeting with a shady US representative. What followed was a very clever and thought provoking 5 minute scene carried solely by extremely well written dialogue.I thought the whole episode was meant to pivot around this scene. It did for me and I increased the stars accordingly.A few stories have been a little, (or a lot), cringe-worthy with a slightly alien, (very British), approach to the overseas viewer. Overall I keep watching and looking for the gems."
2,6, Spoilers of the Future Politics!,7.0,"I don't know why this episode is rated so much low! Perhaps it was released back in 2013 so that people might not understood it's premises!
But when we see today's world of politics, we might get a question in our mind.
Is it a Spoiler of our future politics?Anyways! A great episode it was and the leading character ""WALDO"" is totally Badass. Ha ha the way he talks, the instant way he make jokes of MPs are really cool. Overall it was not that Hi-Tech futuristic technology concept type episode, like all other previous episodes of Black Mirror, but I personally Loved it.And that's why gonna rate it for 7 out of 10 Stars. This episode contains some abusive words and a sexually explicit scene so avoid watching with family!"
2,6, Extrapolation of current politics,7.0,"Weaker (but not weak) episode. The the episode further develops the topics featured in National Anthem and thanks to other aspects The Waldo Moment will be relevant for a long time. Voter apathy, ad hominem attacks, lies, rigidity, idleness and populism are, unfortunately, parts of modern politics. The episode exagerates most of it, but the similarity to real world is still there."
2,6, I see what this episode for...,6.0,"I see political apathy and Waldo.... this episode spend too much time with Jamie. I want to see after Jamie resigned. But Waldo was very funny and slow tempo of the episode made me feel like I was one of the public in the episode, which was great."
2,6," Great, underrated episode",10.0,"I don't know if this episode really deserves a 10 rating, but it was a fantastic episode, in a highly inventive series. Definitely not the weakest in the series: that one would be Nosedive. (Even that episode was really good, but the first 40 minutes were pure torture to get through.)This episode deserves a much higher rating, overall. Ignore the negative reviews and judge for yourself."
2,6, Ehh,5.0,"Definitely a low point in the show as a whole. Although it was semi prophetic of society, it just didn't strike me as intense and unnerving as most other episodes. I think the stakes were just too low.
It was also the only episode I can remember where I didn't actually feel bad for one or more of the characters by the end. I'm not sure if Jamie just wasn't very sympathetic or if I felt he basically brought the hardships at the end on himself. Either way, I just didn't really care what happened to him. 5/10"
2,6," Episode has potential, but ultimately falls flat",6.0,"I ultimately appreciate the message the writers convey here about the intersection of politics, pop culture, comedy, and technology. However, everything about the Waldo character falls flat. Waldo is unpleasant to listen to and look at. It doesn't help that the writing for the Waldo character is terrible, he's neither funny nor insightful in any way. The actor voicing him does a terrible job at it, the timbre is unpleasant and he doesn't sound like any kind of professional voice actor. He sounds like if you asked any rando on the street to immediately come up with some kind of fake voice.I suppose the lack of depth to Waldo's insights was partially intentional, a statement on the influence of shallow comedy on real politics. Either way nothing about the Waldo character works, to me, hiring an actual professional voice actor could have gone a long way here."
2,7, One of the best.,10.0,"SPOILER: The British sci-fi anthology series consists of various tales about how technology will possibly create a more hellish world in the near future...and none of the episodes I have seen so far are as hellish a future as this one.The story is set in a room with two men. One is talkative and a bit jovial and the other, apparently, has been mostly silent the last five years. What follows are two stories by the more talkative man as he recounts how he abused technology. And, these stories, in turn, help the quiet man to finally start talking and he tells a very sad story about losing his wife/girlfriend (not sure which)...and she was pregnant! He desperately wants to see her and work things out...as well as see his child. But thanks to modern tech, he literally CAN'T see either as unfriending takes on a strange and sad finality.I really don't want to say too much about this one...it's not an easy episode to explain AND it would give away too much. Suffice to say it's exquisitely written, very moving as well as scary to imagine such an awful and hellish future...all perhaps possible one day thanks to technology. See this one!!"
2,7, A Well Constructed Nightmare,8.0,"These episodes are about things that frighten us more than any threat physical or otherwise. The invite us into a world where we are alone and hopeless. We always think about eternity in some pit of hell, with devils and pitchforks. This is about the impossibility of redemption. There are forces at work that punish without mercy and leave people to face eternity alone. No human contact. No dignity. So what can they do. This one is about two men in an old house in the middle of nowhere, telling stories about why they have been imprisoned. These are horrible tales of murder and ugliness. One man is a master salesman who works the technology of the time to gain his prurient ends. The second a sad, unstable jerk who crosses his wife and is doomed to not see his child. No one really looks at her except we know that she faced some really sad times. These are powerful and almost sick."
2,7," The Darkest, Creepiest and Best ""Black Mirror""",9.0,"Joe Potter (Rafe Spall) wakes up on the Christmas Day and finds his talkative co-worker Matt Trent (Jon Hamm) preparing the Christmas dinner. They have been working together for five years in a remote outpost in the middle of nowhere in the snow. Joe does not like to talk, but Matt decides to tell his story. Matt was helping the shy Harry (Rasmus Hardiker) to seduce the beautiful Jennifer (Natalia Tena) in a party using the ""Z-Eye"" implanted in his eyes in an illegal procedure. Harry succeeds and they go to Jennifer's apartment but things go awry and they die. Matt delete the evidences of his participation but his wife blocks him and they become invisible and inaudible to each other. Then Matt explains that he really worked with a chip called Cookie, capable to make a digital copy of the user. Then he forced the copy to serve the real user through torture manipulating time to break any resistance from the copy. Joe decides to tell why he came to the outpost and he explains that he lived with Beth (Janet Montgomery). One night, they have dinner with their friends Tim (Dan Li) and Gita (Zahra Ahmadi) and Beth is feeling tired and absent. She goes to bed and Joe cleans the kitchen. However, he accidentally drops the garbage on the floor and he sees a positive pregnancy test. He questions Beth and she tells that she will abort the baby. They have an argument and Beth blocks and leaves Joe. One day, he accidentally finds her silhouette on the street and he discovers that she is raising her child with her father. However he is incapable to see neither Beth nor the child since he is still blocked. But when Beth dies in a train accident, Joe goes to her father's house to see his child and he has a surprise. But where the outpost is located? ""White Christmas"" is the darkest, creepiest and also the best episode of ""Black Mirror"". The story is original despite the predictable conclusion. The plot is very disturbing and cruel and the idea of the Cookie is scary. Joe Potter is a totally unlucky guy: has an unfaithful girlfriend; a disloyal friend; a false co-worker; a daughter that is not of his own; he accidentally commits the murders; and he will be punished for eternity along Christmas. Poor man! My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): Not available"
2,7, Blissfully dark viewing. Darker then the toast.,10.0,"I think the first time round I watched it I didn't fully absorb into it, subsequently I would now class it as one of the very best. It's is definitely one of the darkest, bleakest and down right sadistic episodes, and for a show like Black Mirror that's really saying something. I've tried to think up one narrative that links each episode of Black Mirror, and it's tough, the closest I've gotten is that mankind will always use technology to take advantage of others, be it monetary, political or for love. We get three stories in this episode and that rule could definitely apply in each case. I love the idea of three stories combining to make one, it's a technique that's not often used, but when it does it's hugely satisfying, each story links with each other, elements would also reappear in later stories, such as Arkangel.Lots of questions come out of it, did Potter get rough justice, or was he the victim, was Matt a good or a bad guy? Is under cooked toast actually edible? You could debate and argue it for hours. John Hamm and Rafe Spall were excellent, two very strong performances. Visually dazzling as always.The top of many people's Christmas watch list I shouldn't wonder."
2,7," ""There's no such thing as real people.""",10.0,"I was compelled to watch this episode of 'Black Mirror' a second time. There seems to be no doubt that the series has a fascination with dealing severe retribution and justice for crimes against humanity. 'White Bear' was a good story, but this one was brilliant in it's execution, weaving it's way through three interconnecting stories with Smartelligence agent Matthew (Jon Hamm) guiding us along. Each of those individual stories stand well on their own, but the way things are brought around to their ultimate conclusion is shocking in it's cycle of unending repetition. Watching the series in order, this one is so far the best that 'Black Mirror' has to offer, but I wouldn't be surprised if writer Charlie Brooker tops even himself in a later episode. The question is, where else can you go from here?"
2,7," ""I'm dreaming of a black mirror.""",10.0,"Despite having heard of it for years,I've never seen a episode of Black Mirror. Discovering online about a X-Mas special from the show,I looked into the mirror for the first time.View on the episode:The first American protagonist in the run of the series, Jon Hamm gives a excellent performance as Matt,with Hamm playing on his sharp suit image, via Matt presenting a front image of being casually likeable and easy to approach,which acts as a mask to his hideous psychopathic actions.Sharing a birthday with Hamm (March 10th) Rafe Spall gives a subtle turn as Potter, whose jolly festive image Spall untangles to revealing the doom-laden misery which has left him lonely this Christmas.For the last episode made for Channel 4, the screenplay by Charlie Brooker ends this era of the series on a high, with the three separate stories recording cyber-stalking, AI increasingly infringing on society, and ""blocking"" on social media, all tied with a bow that packages them as Sci-Fi anthology morality tales.Gradually bringing to light the surroundings they are in the more the duo reveal about themselves in the tales, Brooker unwraps the wrap-around story with a deliciously macabre twist ending leaving Matt and Potter in a state where they will be wishing it is Christmas everyday."
2,7, Christmas will never be the same again,9.0,"A compelling Christmas addition to Black Mirror, with this episode broadcast in 2014. I'm now catching up on the earlier episodes of Black Mirror.Anyway, Jon Hamm guides viewers through this Christmas special, with Rafe Spall wrapping up the episode with his story. Two Spanish actresses, Oona Chaplin and Natalia Tena (who was in About a Boy) appear, along with Janet Montgomery, Brian Li and Leanne Li.Production values were impressive, and you could feel the English snow on screen!I now have to subscribe to Netflix to catch up on seasons 3, 4 and 5, and also Bandersnatch."
2,7," Slow at times and kind of obvious after a while, but still damn good!",8.0,"Funny enough, at the end of the show the voice of the TV announcer advertised the next show: the conviction of a pedophile. It was completely unintentional and really ironic.John Hamm again perfectly plays the charismatic, but self serving ass. Him and another guy are isolated somewhere during Christmas so they begin telling their stories and how they arrived there. Slowly, but surely, the main thread of the Black Mirror show is revealed, showing us how technology can be misused by people who don't even comprehend the consequences. The finale is truly maddening, so to speak.I loved the first season of Black Mirror, but I was kind of disappointed with the second. This Christmas special is top notch and is certainly worth a watch. It was slightly too long and some of the hints were really obvious, as well as some issues being over dramatized to the loss of consistency. However it did reach its point rather well."
2,7, The horror of Christmas music.,8.0,"'White Christmas (2014)' caps off the second series of 'Black Mirror (2011-)' in style; it's easily the best episode of that season. It's also unusual because it's, essentially, an extended Christmas special. The thing is centred around two men telling tales as they eat their roast dinner, with the stories getting progressively more intense as they go on. Each segment is interesting in and of itself, but each one is ultimately integral to the overall story. The scenes with Hamm and Spall aren't just framing devices, even if they do serve that function. The affair is consistently character-driven and often surprising. Its brilliant, typically understated performances convey each beat perfectly. The themes it explores are intriguing and, as usual, deeply tragic; Brooker really knows how to twist the knife. As an aside, I'd be shocked if the developers of 'Soma (2015)' haven't seen this; the two pieces have quite a bit in common. That's not a sleight on either party, mind, just an observation. In the end, this is one of the best episodes of the entire show. 8/10"
2,7, 9,9.0,Very nice episode that's what exactly what I want to see.
2,7," ""It wasn't really real, so it wasn't really barbaric.""",8.0,"Imagine having a block function from social networks available in real life. In the unspecified future, people have chips in their temples, similar to those in The Entire History of You, which, among many other functions (such as taking photos by eyes), allow them to block other people, so that they can no longer see or hear each other.In addition, the extracted chip automatically becomes your mental clone, a self-conscious copy of your mind that functions independently of you.Both of these chip functions are very useful in this futuristic society, but, as in previous episodes, the question arises again as to how ethical and humane modern technology is, and whether it is worth the risk of countless possibilities of abuse.The script consists of three intertwined stories, incredibly well worked out in just over an hour. The story is complex just enough to maintain attention and tension without getting lost in the perplexity. Great actors bring us well-written characters with whom it is easy to identify, so, in addition to an interesting premise, which makes us introspect, we also have a strong emotional drama. And like the icing on the cake, the episode ends with a pretty effective twist.An additional plus for me is the presence of a large number of ""easter egg"" references to almost all previous episodes, which indicate the possibility that all previous ""Black Mirror"" stories are placed in the same time frame. Perhaps the best episode so far.8,5/10."
2,7, Hell in snow for Christmas,9.0,"A strange situation, or maybe two strange situations. On one side a peeping-tom voyeur who uses modern technology to get inside the bedroom and the bed of two people who are going to have casual sex, the man having been guided step by step into the situation and into this end by the voyeur and his audience. But unluckily the woman is different and for her, this sex episode has to be the full and final contact with the man she has selected, and thus sex for her is death for both.The voyeur did not report the crime and thus is in custody pending some sentencing.On the other hand, a young man discovers by accident his wife is pregnant. She declares she wants to get rid of the child. He refuses. She uses some advanced technology to block him for her. Both cannot have any contact at all until she lifts the blockage. But she dies in a car accident, leaving the child behind in the hands of her father.The supposed estranged father is no longer blocked and he can approach the child. He discovers the child is not his, but that of an Asian friend of the family. Out of rage he kills the father and abandons the child who dies in the cold outside when she leaves the house. The man is imprisoned and the victim of a sentence that blocks him in the father's house, the child dead outside in the snow, but he refuses to confess and there are no witnesses.The police use the great competence of the voyeur to project himself into the house and lead the man to confess his crimes. He is condemned to spend an eternity in this house with blaring Christmas music, each one of the real-time minutes is experienced as if it were five years long. The voyeur as for him is free but he is blocked by everyone and is thus condemned to have no contact whatsoever with any human. Tomorrow technology is leading us to the worst possible enslavement to the police, the state and some kind of fatalistic future. To get some pleasure and adventure you have to break the law. There is no escape: it will be known sooner or later and then you will be turned into some kind of virtual being going through some unimaginable torture. Welcome to hell on earth and in prison.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
2,7, Season Two,7.0,"After watching the First Season (3 episodes) of Black Mirror, I was intrigued enough to keep going (albeit not exactly sold on each hour).For the first three episodes of Season Two, I experienced much of the same. Some things I liked...somethings I did not. Again, as was a problem in S1, the show seemed to focus on the technology of each episode instead of developing the characters to their fullest.But then comes ""White Christmas"" (the finale of this season), and that episode changes everything. Starring Jon Hamm, this episode really showcases the type of storytelling that Black Mirror could (and should) be focusing on. This single episode is head-and-shoulders above everything that precedes it.So, on the whole, this is a 3.5 star season from me. However, the large caveat is that it looks like the show may have figured out the winning formula to maximize its potential. It will be very interesting to see if the momentum can be sustained into the third season."
2,7," The most memorable, although unpleasant on many levels",8.0,"Thanks to the smooth, handsome presence of Jon Hamm this is an eminently watchable episode. However, Hamm brings across some of the creepiness of his Don Draper character.Stuck in an outpost with a ""colleague"", named Joe, the Hamm character (named Matt) starts telling how he ended up in the allegedly sh**y job, far removed from society. As a sidelines from his main job, Matt used to run a sort of dating service, giving real-time advice to insecure men on how to hook up with girls. Unethically, Matt shared these experiences live, with his previous clients. Voyeurism turns into Matt's demise, when one of his clients hooks up with the wrong girl. Then Matt starts talking about his main job and from this moment it is clear where the episode is heading. Matt's job is actually convincing his ""colleague"" Joe to open up about his past and since Matt is so smooth you can bet he will succeed.The story takes place during the Christmas period and the festive atmosphere adds more creepines to the unfolding tale. Do not expect a happy ending (sorry Matt, not even for you, since you don't deserve it)"
2,7, Fan-freaking-tastic,9.0,This is an insanely awesome episode of TV. Twists and turns every 10 minutes. Fantastic plot development. The best episode.
2,7, One of the best episodes of Black Mirror!,10.0,"This one hits hard and is an illustration of human cruelty that is, at times, difficult to stomach.The blend of stories in this episode is a winning formula and all three stories are compelling and each gets increasingly more disturbing.The cruelty is so well desgined it is easy to empathise with, this makes it an emotional ride throughout and has you questioning whether the human psyche could actually cope with the trauma and torture of these futuristic devices.The concepts are genius and the execution is brilliant!10/10"
2,7, Masterfull!,10.0,"WHITE CHRISTMAS can easily be called the best Black Mirror episode ever, and based on it's lofty 9+ rating, not surprising. A clinic in atmosphere, storytelling, writing , and acting, White Christmas incorporates various technologies already presented on the series and expands upon them to a point where it seems like the future has been laid out. Anchored by a brilliant, award-worthy performance by TV icon Jon Hamm (Emmy winner from Mad Men), this episode is captivating start to finish. White Christmas starts off in a remote cabin with 2 men seemingly imprisoned there, cut off from society. The 2 men are Matt (the aforementioned Hamm) and Joe (a superb Rafe Spall), who share each other's stories in an effort to break the boredom, all the while cooking up and feasting on a very British Christmas meal. Joe is actually British while Matt is an American living in England.We find out that Matt is a manipulative, smooth-talking closer, both in his day job and his extracurricular activities, while Joe is a more innocent, humane person who seems like he couldn't hurt a fly. Layers and layers are deftly revealed throughout the episode, all the while some nifty technology is showcased, including that Bluetooth-like eye technology first shown in The Entire History of You, as well as a much more advanced version of the digital cookies tech first shown in Be Right Back. But the director smartly mixes the technology into the story, and not allowing it to dominate. Instead the very real and true human characters shine.In addition to the 2 great leads Hamm and Spall (both of whom should have won awards), the supporting cast, including a now fairly famous Janet Montgomery, all make this splendid episode come to life. In particular, Oona Chaplin (as Greata) and Rasmus Hardiker (as Harry) stand out as they played big roles in 2 of the 3 stories. Interestingly, this was really a Special Christmas episode, but has been coined as the official last episode of Season 2 (even though it came out close to 2 years after the end of that season), then Season 3 came out two full years after this. I think the series didn't really garner worldwide attention until Netflix took over. A shame because I feel this masterpiece of an episode deserved serious acclaim and award recognition."
2,7, Interwoven cautionary tales on the dangers of brain-technology hookups,9.0,"""Black Mirror"" doesn't really do feelgood Christmas, so there is only the flimsiest of connections here - and that's OK. Basically this one's about downloading enough of a person's brain patterns to generate a pseudo-human being inside a computer framework. But it's also about implants allowing people to block out the words and appearance of others if they so wish, or en masse as a form of punishment. These are then exquisitely devious and truly awful ways of making people - or pseudo-people - suffer, and there are really no holds barred to the subtle forms of torture depicted in this extended episode.Found myself wondering what a person who for years could only see blurred images and hear blurred voices of people around them would do. Thank God (literally) nature and architecture would still exist, and would doubtless become a life focus for such unfortunates. The (fortunate!) unreality is arrived at when one asks how such a punished person would purchase anything at the supermarket! Obviously, this plotline cannot actually work - though that doesn't make the thing much less oppressive.A similar - tangible - claustrophobia arises with the entrapment in software of a person's brain patterns. And shades of ""Never Let Me Go"" here, as a person actually has an operation to have this second self removed and put into an Alexa-type piece of equipment that then runs the house for - and the lives of - the organic originals. The copies don't actually like that role very much, so cue episode star John Hamm as a person in an entirely new profession - the breaking and taming of those entrapped as intelligences wholly deprived of human rights and freedoms but still feeling human, who are needless to say unwilling to cooperate. So what does he do? He speeds up the timeframe from our point of view, while letting those inside the software believe that weeks, months or even millennia have passed. And, since the only worthwhile activity left for these beings is back out in the ""real world"", the blocking of contact with that world is an unimaginably cruel deprivation. Basically, then, that's awful new form of torture number 2!Another sideline of this character called ""Matt"" is that he previously acted as an online life coach to people whose eyes can now beam back each happenning live, allowing Matt (and in fact also his backup team of online geeks) to give the best advice to the person with the implant, potentially allowing them to hit it off with potential dates. This is more conventional ""Black Mirror"" fare, perhaps, but still creepy and redolent with exploitation and manipulation.Matt also has a role in trying to get the detached intelligence of a flesh-and-blood criminal to confess, with the charge and punishment then being passed back to the ""real"" killer.You see how ""convenient"" these stored intelligences can be?The way these stories interlock through Matt is great, if definitely full of disturbing dystopian aspects; and on the way we get to see some pretty good acting from Oona Chaplin, Janet Montgomery, Rafe Spall and others.And, by the way, we know it's alternative reality, because in this version of the UK snow is a regular feature of winters! A clever touch to a clever episode of a mostly-clever series, I must say...But all is indeed very, very COLD!"
2,7, A focused special episode,9.0,"This review contains spoilers.The episode opens with Matt, played by Jon Hamm, and Joe, played by Rafe Spall talking in a cabin. They both discuss their pasts as they await Christmas. The world in this episode utilizes cookies, blocks, and 2-Eyes. This world is a more connected and technologically advanced society. Matt in this episode recounts using the 2-eyes to both spy on and assist men find women. The society also uses cookies and blocks to stop communication from people in real-life. The cookies are used to create artificial intelligence from someone's own memories.White Christmas is a strong episode for Black Mirror. This episode has great performances from its actors. The highlight actor here being Jon Hamm. This world is also fun to explore and see. Although this episode can elicit sad emotions, the episode keeps this in mind and delivers a great plot. There is a lot going on in this episode and its long runtime helps deliver the story.The last act of this episode is a great culmination of what the episode leds up to. The intersection of technology and cruelty is at the focus here. The blocks can render people only more obsessive and this is reflected with Joe. I felt for Joe as I saw his story play out.I highly recommend Black Mirror's episode ""White Christmas"".Grade: ABlack Mirror Season TwoThe second season of Black Mirror contains three episodes and a special episode. The second season it takes more of its episodes from the third episode of the first season. The second season explores alternate realities with more a science fiction twist. This second season is an incredibly strong season. the weakest episode is ""The Waldo Moment"" but even this is still a strong episode.Each of the episodes explores a separate theme related to its central point of people. The Christmas special episode in particular shows the effects of a block on people that exists in real-life. This season is not a happy season with much of its themes being derived from the more negative emotions of humanity.Like the first season, none of the episodes are linked in any way. Although this is fun to explore, I would have liked to know more about some of the worlds in this season's episodes.I highly recommend the second season of Black Mirror.Grade: A"
2,7, blew it at the end,5.0,"wpersonally I found the last several episodes of this series to be weak, flimsy, or bogged down by a morality system that seems so abnormal as to be alien.this episode was strong almost all the way through, with great storytelling aspects gradually connecting each story until you piece together just what's happened. ideas like the person-blocking is mindnumbingly fascinating and painful and even explored to a tantalizing degree without overdoing it.then the alien morality kicks in with an end that just completely sours the entire episode. the protagonist of the story has basically used his people skills and gotten into serious trouble, and now is using them to get out of trouble, helping police officials in extracting a confession out of a computer program copy of a killer who has not spoken to anyone in real life.His reward is he doesn't serve jail time for his own incredibly minor crime, and is basically worse than death; he's blocked by everyone, as a result of being put on a ""peeping tom"" list only vaguely reminiscent of real life sex offender registries.This is effectively a death sentence, as someone who is blocked by everyone basically cannot interact with anyone in any way. As such, they cannot hold a job and make money to pay rent or buy food or medicine or clothing, cannot communicate with emergency personnel in the event of a medical emergency, so he's essentially dead the moment he suffers a heart attack or a stroke or a blown appendix.He's got a good face and is charismatic, he makes his living off talking to people and getting them to open up. Being unable to do that, he's on the streets, a perpetual outcast, blind, deaf, and mute, on top of having a special red glow marking him as a sexual predator with no explanation as to whether he's an insane violent serial rapist killer or just a guy who watched some people have sex. He's dead within a year, of illness or victim of violence.to add on to the abnormal morality, the alien creature posing as a human decides to punish NOT the actual killer, but the computer copy of the killer to essentially an eternity of being trapped alive in a cabin with Christmas music playing nonstop.The unusual fixation on this sort of alien sense of morality that keeps getting tacked on to the end of these episodes (like with ""White Bear"") becomes hugely distracting and detracting from the episode as a whole, like following up a fine meal with an unexplained vomit-filled balloon dropped onto your plate and exploding in your face. Sure, the food was good, but what was the point of the vomit bomb? What am I supposed to learn from this? Now the vomit part is all I will remember."
2,7," Awesome idea and premise, but all consequences are highly exaggerated",8.0,"The idea and underlying questions of this episode are phenomenal, and I understand why it's regarded as one of the best episodes. Questions of morality and benefits of duplicating consciousness, and the rights of a synthetic consciousness, lack easy answers but are increasingly relevant. The gradual reveals showing more about each of their characters, the world they inhabit, and why they're really there is all extremely well done. It truly took me out of the story when characters repeatedly way overreacted to everything. Both of their wives freak out and block them over not that insane things - a verbal fight over abortion and running an illegal business helping men talk to women. Then, in addition to the blocking, they are given crazy legal punishments - being driven completely insane by immorally subjecting the clone to years of isolation and being blocked from literally everyone in society. It's such a good episode in all of its ideas and script, but the results were just so unreasonable."
2,7, How'd like your Toast ? White maybe ?,10.0,"One of the greatest pieces of T.V. put together IMHO in the history of the smaller screen. Period.John Hamm better than Mad MenIts just so intriguing, what a wonderful way to celebrate Christmas or any day.Arrrrrrr yes looking into a black mirror on Christmas day.Solid 10"
2,7, Im dreaming of a .....,10.0,"Bonus 3 stories in one and for those who like Easter Egg bonuses then this is cram packed with post episode and pre episode its the gift that just keeps giving.The first major US star , an unforgettable twist which then as a bleak black mirror twist with finally the most .... well its up to you to watch it.I wouldn't be surprised if this season 2 classic isnt a lot of people's fave but mine is white bear , this still however is a solid 10 out 10"
2,7," A review of Season 2 of ""Black Mirror"" (2013)",9.0,"""Black Mirror"" seems to me to be  the best science fiction show on television; I'd rate Season 2 (2013) a 9 out of 10.  (I'm never quite certain whether to group British shows by ""season"" or by ""series,"" as they do.  I'm also a little uncertain why the fourth and final episode here, ""White Christmas,"" is included in Season 2, as it aired nearly two years later as a 2014 holiday special.)I commented to a friend of mine after seeing ""White Christmas"" the other night that the show was ""brave"" -- it just isn't afraid to alienate mainstream audiences by being too dark.  Not all of ""Black Mirror's""  episodes have ""twists,"" but they typically have an unexpected plot development, and their outcomes and implications are arguably depressing.It's just such a damned good show, though, in terms of its writing and acting.  My friend told me she wasn't aware of anyone who had seen it and disliked it. ""White Christmas,"" for example, was one of the best hours of science fiction television I've ever seen.  It consists of three blackly tragic vignettes seamlessly woven withing a wraparound story, and it employs a sci-fi plot device that is mind-bending and brutal.  I believe this is the first time I've seen its lead actor, Jon Hamm, and I was extremely impressed with his performance.My only quibbles with the program are extremely minor.  As with the first season, I think that not every episode truly requires a 44- minute running length.  I thought two episodes  (""Be Right Back"" and ""The Waldo Moment"") seemed like they could have been tightened up into one, maybe with tighter writing allowing for shorter segments. I've noticed another minor relative weakness with ""Black Mirror"" in general as well -- the show does not always present the viewer with likable protagonists.  Occasionally, the various characters we're asked to identify with are either slightly off-putting or even annoying.  Again, ""Be Right Back"" and ""The Waldo Moment"" spring to mind.  This wasn't enough to greatly affect my enjoyment of the episodes, though.What an incredible show."
3,8, Not hard to envision this future....,10.0,"Season 1 and 2 of ""Black Mirror"" were made in the UK. After a hiatus, Netflix got involved and has financed new episodes...and I notice that the actors tend to be more American in the newer episodes. This one is the first of the new episodes...and a nice beginning it is. Hopefully the rest of the new episodes will maintain this momentum.In the very near future, social media has gone crazy. Now folks instantly rate each other...even when they have brief interactions, such as meeting on an elevator or waiting in line. Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) is very much a product of this environment and she works hard to present as a sweet person in order to get high ratings. However, lately her ratings have begun to slip...and this is a serious problem when she is trying to get to a wedding. Why is this wedding so important? The lady getting married is not really any sort of close friend...but this lady is SUPER-popular and might help Lacie to increase her rating just by hanging with her and being the best maid of honor in the world! But something HORRIBLE happens at the airport. What this is and how she deals with it is what makes this a very funny episode.It's an interesting coincidence that the same time this episode debuted John Fortson created a short film with pretty much the same theme. ""Rating"" is just as clever and is also worth seeing. And, most importantly, both have a lot to say about how crazy and potentially damaging social media is...and I pray it never gets to this...but wouldn't be surprised if it did.By the way, the ending of this one is VERY embarrassing....so hold on tight!!"
3,8, Another Look at Our Shallowness,8.0,"A culture has developed where people are rated on some arbitrary scale. The main character is doing whatever she can to get above her 4.2 status. People will reject her because they are ""superior"" in number. She is totally shallow, attempting to make the kind of connections that will boost her up a couple decimal points. So when she meets people, she can look at a phone and see what their level is. The way we treat people isn't much different than this as we look at things that have nothing to do with substance. As with most of these episodes, things are taken to the nth degree. Interesting encounters as she goes to the wedding of a beautiful woman who mistreated her but would be useful in upping her rating."
3,8, A Great Criticism to the Excessive Use of Social Media,8.0,"In a near future, people are rated by the others through the cellphone facilitating life or not depending on the personal rating. Lacie Pound (Bryce Dallas Howard) is obsessed by her high score and is very polite with everybody expecting to increase her rating. Her brother Ryan (James Norton) does not care and has lower rating irritating Lacie. When her best friend Naomi Jayne Blestow (Alice Eve) invites her to be her maid of honor in her wedding, Lacie foresee the chance to increase her rating and prepares a speech. When she arrives at the airport, she learns that her flight was canceled and she does not have enough rating to get a seat in another plane. She has a problem with the attendant and she is ranked down in the beginning of her downfall to a journey where she will learn the importance of being free to speak and act.""Nosedive"" is a witty episode of ""Black Mirror"" with a great criticism to the excessive use of social media mostly by the younger generations. Bryce Dallas Howard has an awesome performance in the role of a young woman obsessed by her personal rating that learns the importance to be free of the excessive use of social media. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Nosedive"""
3,8, A scary delve into what could be.,6.0,"I have to say I am stunned by the high score this one has, higher then many other episodes. I like the concept, I like the message, but the delivery I personally didn't care a great deal for. The harsh, bleak core of the show is lacking here, it's garish and syrupy in its execution, all the elements that make Black Mirror the addictive show that it is just aren't here. Nothing wrong with the performances, well acted, but almost all of the characters are loathsome, it's hard to believe that most people would be so shallow. The message is powerful, how many times does one walk into a coffee shop or step on a train and find everyone with their heads down transfixed by their phone, how many times do see companies desperate for feedback."
3,8," ""It was like taking off tight shoes.""",8.0,"I'm led to wonder how I would handle the social media world if I were in my Twenties or Thirties, since I'm a seasoned citizen now retired. There's the possibility I would be all caught up in things like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as a result of hanging with my peers, but the other side of me still cautions that I should be wary against the invasive nature of all these platforms. This episode takes the Twitter follower concept and adds an even more self absorbed element by way of the five star rating system that puts every one of it's users on a hopelessly frantic treadmill. Imagine hiring a social media coach to point out your areas needing improvement in the personal skills arena?I thought Bryce Dallas Howard did a nice job conveying the vapidness of her character. I could tell when I wanted to strangle her over the 'Lay-Lay/Nay-Nay' exchange with her faux gal pal Naomi Jane Blestow (Alice Eve). Nay Nay had just the perfect complement of friends and admirers attending her wedding reception. No doubt everyone coming out of that ceremony would have gotten a high five, five star rating as a result. For the sake of the story, Lay Lay's long, rambling descent into hysteria was nicely done and well expected, but wouldn't have had much of a chance of happening in real life. She would have been bodily tackled if necessary before putting such a damper on the whole affair. If you're wondering about my summary line, that's truck driver Susan (Cherry Jones) explaining how wonderful it felt for her to ditch the phoniness of going along to get along. She was about the only real person in the entire story, unless you want to consider Lacie and the man in jail (Sope Dirisu) at the very end of the story. It looked to me like they were falling for each other."
3,8, MeowMeowBeenz,7.0,"Having first watched seasons 1 and 2 (along with the White Christmas special) that were all filme in England, it was refreshing to see sunshine in this season 3 opener on Netflix. Even though Nosedive was set in the USA, it was filmed in South Africa, as I read somewhere that Charlie Booker says it's a nightmare to try to film in the USA.Anyway, this was a biting commentary on ratings (Uber, Instagram and of course iMDB!) and I was kind of hoping for some sort of redemptive scene at the end. But not to be really.Also, much has been written about the similarity of this plot with Community's season 5 episode App Development and Condiments, which was originally two years before Nosedive."
3,8, 3.5/5,7.0,"'Nosedive (2016)' is the first episode of 'Black Mirror (2011-)' to be produced by Netflix, shifting the focus over to America while keeping the same the 'tech gone wild' theming. The episode is set in a world in which everyone's worth is defined by an arbitrary rating system that dictates what you can and cannot do within society. This score is constantly changing, affected as much by chance encounters as it is by traditional social media posts. As such, those who want to achieve a higher standard of living must bend over backwards to please everyone they come across, basically held prisoner by their own aspirations. Those with a high score are viewed as worthy, while those with a low score are not. Of course, this is the episode's take on ethnic and socioeconomic discrimination. Our protagonist desperately seeks to raise her score above four and a half out of five so that she can get a discount on her dream home, manufacturing fake moments of happiness and ruthlessly shunning former friends along the way. However, despite her constant attempts to remain prim and proper to even the most distant stranger, she soon learns that the path to becoming a sub-three is a slippery one and that the whole system is built upon foundations of human suffering. As you can probably tell, the episode is chock full of interesting themes that it explores in an intelligent and entertaining way. That's what we all expect from 'Black Mirror (2011-)', I suppose. However, the thing isn't as gripping or generally affecting as the best episodes of the series. Still, it's a solid, enjoyable piece of television. 7/10"
3,8, 8,8.0,"It was quite decent beginning of new season. It shows a lot of real things. We all need likes for our pictures, we all want to be famous but it's not the most important things in the life."
3,8," ""There's sugary and then there's ... diabetes!""",8.0,"Another futuristic episode in which life comes down to popularity on social networks. Your every action, every word, is rewarded or punished by people from your environment by adding or subtracting points on your profile. From your position on a one to five stars scale directly depends your social position and your opportunities in life, from where you will live and what work you will do, to the most banal little things such as which car you will be able to get in the rent-a-car agency.We already have an extremely large number of mostly young people addicted to social networks, whose lives are reduced to Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. It is a common sight that groups of young people, instead of hanging out, stare at their phones. But social networks also have an impact on those who have not so obviously succumbed to them, because they greatly influence public opinion and all spheres of public life.This episode is not really SF, but a satirical exaggeration of the reality in which we live, and that is exactly what makes it more convincing and scarier than all that precede it. While in the beginning this caricature is hilarious, as the story progresses, the surreal comedy grows into a real drama with a quite tense atmosphere.Technically well done, with interesting solutions, a surreal atmosphere, and great acting and music, and most of all a topic that is extremely close to us, the episode had the potential for the highest rating. Unfortunately, the ending, although it makes sense, pretty much disappointed me. I think they could have finished it much more powerful and impressive.8,5/10."
3,8, Tripped on the ending,7.0,"I was really enjoying this episode right up until the last couple of scenes. I thought it was building towards a satisfying conclusion where her friend would get some kind of comeuppance. Instead I found that the wedding Party speech scene and the subsequent scene in the cells just felt zany and bonkers and manic without any purpose.I don't really understand why she was screaming that she loves her friend as she was dragged away. I don't feel like this element was established.I give it points because I like the idea of the episode re: social status credits and whatnot, and the majority of happy happy land was portrayed in an interesting way."
3,8, Most disturbing despite the soft look,8.0,"The contrast between the pastel-color photography and the bleak reality of an hypocrite society makes this episode a brilliant one.We open with the cheerful image of a pretty, well-dressed girl, living in a pretty, pastel coloured world... but unfortunately all that we see is fake. People spend their time obsessively rating each other, because in this society high rates work as a currency and allows you to have a better life.Consequently, social climbers lie all the time and many people try frantically to increase their rating overdoing what is already going on nowadays in social platforms.Everybody runs their own reality show, but they need an audience to share their successes, regardless of who they really are - and as it often happens, the most popular are also the most hypocrite.Dangerously close to happen IRL, as anybody knows we're already receiving requests to rate services... will people be next? And what about those who refuse to play this obsessive, hypocrite game?"
3,8, Dang,8.0,I hope this never happens in real life. My rating would be really lame and I think I would go crazy.
3,8," Loved this one, hillarious and also a genuine warning to a new generation!",9.0,"Nosedive is satire at it's very best!The story is so cleverly put together and played beautifully by the cast. It had me laughing my head off while shaking my head at the reality of the message aimed at our judgemental, social networking society. Of course, nosedive takes the message to a whole new level in classic black mirror style, but this is going on the world we live in today and frankly it's scary as hell to think that it may one day come to this!Quality epsiode that really makes you think 9/10"
3,8, Terrible,1.0,"This is the first episode of this anthology series I've watched and hopefully, the rest of the series isn't this bad! Was I supposed to sympathize with Bryce Dallas Howard's character? She was incredibly annoying throughout the entire episode, a fake nice person BEFORE she got wind of the fact that this faux society she lived in was a mirage full of phony, self-involved, self-congratulatory people. And why did she sound like a whiny teenager? She's pushing 40 in real life! LOL Her acting was laughably bad. I couldn't sympathize with her character for a second.In fact, the speech patterns of virtually all the characters were annoying. This is supposed to be the representation of a ""perfect"" world, and the people that talk and act like this in the actual world (yeah, they exist unfortunately) makes me want to plug up my ears. Thank goodness for headphones! And I guess the lesson is that Lacie (Howard's character name, yeesh) is going to end up like that old lady trucker she picked up, but that lady was actually NICE and COOL. There's no way Lacie will end up as genuine as her. The ending made it seem so (by the way, what was that?) but I think she'll just be one of those people that are mean to everyone minus any warmth or wisdom.The future look with the bright colors, pristine landscape, electric cars was actually nice. It's actual believable such a society could exist. And it wasn't the WHOLE society. You still had the gritty underbelly with the trucker lady, a dirt bike riding teen, the jerkish gas station attendant. The truck lady was the ONLY likable character in this and the only actor who brought it. Every other character reeked of awfulness, both in presentation and performance."
3,8, Societal Obsession,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.Black Mirror's first episode in the third season is called ""Nosedive"". The episode is directed by Joe Wright and the story is written by Charlie Brooker. The episode stars Bryce Dallas Howard in the leading role of Lacie Pound. Society has changed to incorporate ratings on each person. There ratings can impact someone's socioeconomic status.""Nosedive"" is an episode with a lot of real world influence. This episode has present day relatability through social networks such as Facebook and apps that allow you to rate people. The very idea on rating people is taken to the extreme in this episode. Entire interactions and purchases are not possible without a high enough rating. Although this seems unfeasible for a society to operate this way, the episode does still play it straight to satirize modern society.This episode is a complete satire of modern insecurity. The episode reflects this well with the main character of Lacie Pound as she embarks on a journey to raise her rating and join her upper class friend. Even without a modern rating system in today's society, many people are afraid of what others may think of them. The system stops people from taking risks. This is reflected well in Lacie's journey. As she traverses the country to get to her friend's party she has to deal with a world that does not always accept her fakeness and insincerity. It was a good scene to see at the end when Lacie finally accepted the system's flaws rather than continue being exploited by the rating system.The episode is incredibly colorful and this reflects the messed up situation the world is in. The episode's looks are clean but underneath the rating system has completely gutted genuine conversation and interaction. Everything is only clean on the surface.I highly recommend Black Mirror's episode entitled ""Nosedive"".Grade: A"
3,8, No finale?,3.0,After all that she still tried to make a good speech...It was soooo booring...THe whole episode was.
3,8, Jeeeeeeees do i know people like this,9.0,"My ex wife without the figure and looks of Bryce.
Yes this is an episode which is not a warning rather a observation amongst our young . Ok the rules are not in place but whos to say its not something this crazy world will never do.Great BM episode IMHO"
3,8, What we are.,9.0,"This episode explains you how much we pretend to fit in this world.
You laugh at joke of someone who is not even funny, you sit with someone who is not even kind, you smile with someone who don't care about you and obviously you do this all because he is famous.
Nosedive explains you there is no meaning of happiness which you get by pretending to be something, you should be happy for what you are and it makes you unique but then comes the society which is just a lie, cheating you for his own purpose.
So it is so simple try to understand those persons who are good to you in your bad situation because only those people matters."
3,8, Social Media satire,10.0,"Nosedive is the closest to our future now. Nowadays most people rely on social media, and their confidence depends upon it. It is really uncomfortable to watch this, mostly because it is so true now. The characters are becoming us now in this modern world.Bryce Dallas Howard deserved an Emmy for this episode."
3,8, 10 Star story idea. It just didn't need to be so long,7.0,The world created in the episode is very prescient. A world where everyone can immediate see and rank anyone's behavior. And the ranking becomes the standard for nearly every aspect of one's standard of life. From one's house availability to parking access in neighborhoods.There is a mutual benefit presented to lying about how one feels and looks. Meanwhile an inconvenient but honest critique gets you in trouble.THe flaw with this episode is that there wasn't enough story to fill the time of the episode. After a while you get the message and can predict the essence of the conclusion even if a few of the details can't be predicted. In the end the details are always going to impossible to predict and largely irrelevant.I feel they should have made this episode about more than one big story arc or else made it about 20 minutes shorter.Then it could have been a 9 or 10.
3,8, Plagiarism of Community,1.0,"This is by far the WORST episode of Black Mirror.With Mr Brooker having sold his soul to America, it was dispassionately obvious that the show was going downhill...This whole plot and story completely ripped off Community. They did it first and Black Mirror copied and made it disappointingly but unsurprisingly worse."
3,8, The dark side of rating system,10.0,"This episode focuses on the rating system that we use to judge online products, cab drivers, restaurants, gyms, tourist places etc. But can it be used to judge human beings? This show portrays it very accurately. The change in the lead woman, her behavior is just awesome. A must watch"
3,9," I think in hindsight, Cooper made a bad choice....",7.0,"Cooper (Wyatt Russell) is backpacking though Europe and now that he's gotten to London he's having a problem. Someone on the other side of the globe just used his credit card number and now his account is frozen. Without funds he is in need of cash...and accepts an offer from a software company to demo a product for pay. But Wyatt is in for far, far more than he bargained as the game is completely real and preys upon his darkest fears.While this is one of the weaker episodes of ""Black Mirror"", this is is not really a terrible thing...as it still is quite enjoyable and worth seeing...even if they do use the f-word 17503 times!By the way, Wyatt Russell is Kurt Russell's son!"
3,9, On the Edge of My Seat,9.0,"A young guy who lives at home, leaves to go on an around-the-world adventure. His father has died of Alzheimers and he feels abandoned. He and his mother have issues. He is a vacuous kind of guy with little imagination and a fixation on modern technology. At one point he talks about how ridiculously boring it must have been in other ages (people actually read books--can you imagine?). When his credit card is compromised, he is stuck in London, and a newly found girlfriend tells him of a possible job. It is with a star video-game developer. Ultimately, after some rather suspicious agreements, he becomes a Guinea pig for the development of a terror game. He is injected with a device that allows his thoughts to become a part of the game. I won't spoil it but he is so naive and so stupid he get in way over his head. Of course, he is chosen because he can be manipulated. There are some interesting plot twists, but the star of the show is the world into which he is thrust. This is about as dark as it can get with some really startling graphics."
3,9, The Video game,8.0,"Cooper Redfield (Wyatt Russell) leaves his estranged mother at home in America to travel around the world. He ignores her phone calls and has good time. When he arrives in London, he meets a young woman called Sonja (Hannah John-Kamen) and they have one night stand. Cooper decides to return to America, but he has no credit and Sonja suggests he could test games at the SaitoGemu Company to raise money for his trip. Cooper is welcome by Katie (Wunmi Mosaku) to test a new technology developed by the owner Shou Saito (Ken Yamamura). He deliver his phone to Katie that turns it off but when she leaves the room. Cooper takes a picture of the technology and sends it to Sonja. Katie returns and implants a device in the back of his neck. They go to a house where the game begins and soon Cooper is not capable to distinguish what is real and what is augmented reality. ""Playtest"" is another great episode of ""Black Mirror"" with a good story of virtual reality. The episode is tense form the moment Copper arrives at the video game company and has a surprising conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Playtest"""
3,9, Edge of the seat viewing.,10.0,"This episode packed in so much, talk about a thrill ride. After a slightly casual, meandering start it develops into what has to be described as classic Black Mirror. When these episodes hit on a theme or a concept that makes you say to yourself 'that could possibly happen,' they work better, and boy this one is along those lines. With the advancements in gaming tech over the years, why on Earth couldn't something like this happen. Outrageous production values, a terrifying concept, fabulous performances, notably from Wyatt Russell and Wunmi Mosaku (the latter being one of the best British talents we have!) all elements add up to make Playtest a rip roaring ride of terror, 57 minutes you'll not want to miss.Would you kindly open the door?"
3,9," ""I have always liked to make the player jump.""",8.0,"Ever have a dream that just seems to go on an on, with so much happening that it feels like you've been inside it for hours or days? And you wake up, and it's only a few minutes since you noticed what time it was before you drifted off to sleep? Aside from all the horrible things that Cooper Redfield (Wyatt Russell) experienced during his 'playtest', the thing that blew my mind was that Cooper died only .04 seconds into his experience! Not much latitude there for correcting things that might go wrong. A possible explanation in the story came from the unexpected call to Cooper's phone interfering with the Harlech Shadow game programming. Considering Black Mirror's effort to keep the viewer off balance and to expect the unexpected, this episode was another resounding success. The mastery of the writing effectively disorients the viewer into thinking that certain aspects of the story have concluded and then you're right back into the virtual reality world once again, never having left. I've never experienced any form of VR myself, but a story like this makes the case for saying 'Stop' before even getting started."
3,9, Playing up,5.0,"Maybe I'm being a bit too unfair in comparing the Netflix reincarnation of Black Mirror to its original Channel 4 seasons 1 and 2. This had an intriguing plot but I'm afraid Wyatt Russell's SHAKING AND SHOUTING was somewhat way over the top. It seems Wyatt tried to channel Jeff Bridges or Nick Nolte. The ending was somewhat pro forma, and almost Twilight Zone-ish for Black Mirror tastes.Hannah John-Kamen was worth watching as Sonja, as was Wunmi Mosaku as Katie, and Ken Yamamura as Shou."
3,9, Playtime's over.,7.0,"'Playtest (2016)' focuses on a young man who gets involved with a mysterious augmented-reality game when he takes a games tester job in order to make some money after his credit card is cloned while he's on a backpacking trip. The bulk of the piece is centred around the protagonist's stay in a spooky old mansion, during which time he is assaulted by visions of his worst fears thanks to the experimental implant plugged into his brain by the developers of the game he's testing. It's typically atmospheric, suitably unnerving stuff. It does a good job of keeping you wondering how real its horrors actually are, as a number of them seem to break the 'it can't hurt you' rule that the developers insist is true. It's generally an entertaining time, well made in pretty much every regard, but its ending lets it down significantly. It goes one step too far in trying to convey the final gut-punch that conclude most 'Black Mirror (2011-)' episodes, undercutting itself in an unsatisfying way. It actually feels a little pretentious, to be honest, and doesn't have the effect it's supposed to. Still, the in-the-moment experience of the affair is solid. It's a well-made short film with more emphasis on traditional horror than is typically seen within the series. 7/10."
3,9, 7,7.0,"It was a little bit too messy, hard to fallow the plot."
3,9, Virtually real,8.0,"Imagine a VR (virtual reality) horror game that reads your subconsciousness and personalizes itself by adapting to your deepest fears, so real (because everything takes place in your head) that your mind is not capable of distinguishing it from reality.""Playtest"" is a psychological horror mindfak, set in the environment of a retro ""haunted house"". The futuristic but potentially realistic premise, charismatic characters, great acting and directing, and an atmosphere similar to Poe or Lovecraft, make it my favorite episode so far. And the plot twists, although unoriginal, are only seemingly predictable and managed to surprise me and leave me under a strong impression.8,5/10."
3,9, Survival Horror,8.0,"This episode took awhile to win me over.At first I found the story dull and the lead actor came across as obnoxious and overconfident; not a character I cared about or cared to know more about.
However, as he descends into paranoia and terror I feel the actor did a commendable job at accurately portraying the panic of the situation. We start to really feel the horror that he is feeling.The Cupboard jumpscare scene where the episode starts to think ahead of audience expectations (and speaks aloud to our thoughts) is where I realised this was going to be a bit more intelligent than I initially expected. It's cleverly done.Had a feeling that the interference from the phone call would be relevant to the story - I'm glad it was explained To a satisfactory extent.Although the idea that he was going to be repeatedly ""stuck in the matrix"" was a pretty obvious one to predict, it's still executed in such a way that it doesn't solely rely on surprise twists to be a satisfying viewing experience.Especially appealing for fans of the survival horror gaming genre.I wasn't completely convinced of the family relationship aspect of the episode - that could have been tweaked a bit or examined in a better way. It didn't really adequately explain why he would abandon and ignore his mother in that way."
3,9, Perhaps two plot twists are a bit much...,7.0,"Main character Cooper is an easy-going American backpacking around the world. He gets stuck in the UK and embarks on a dangerous test for a new ""virtual reality"" game.Due to the nature of the story, it was easy to foresee lots of techno trickery. Also due to the gaming nature, I was hoping for a more light-hearted development. I am not really into ""horror games"" and many of the scary events during the test were just too theatrical to be scary.What spoiled the episode for me was the double twist. I think the first one was effective enough, without adding the second. But see for yourself...."
3,9, Terrifying. Really,9.0,This is one of the scariest pieces of media I have ever witnessed. It's really freaking scary.
3,9," The burning question, would you play?",9.0,"A great black mirror delve into a classic horror concept.I love the horror genre and crave things that scare me. Playtest takes horror to a new level, taking your own fears and turning them against you!Fantastically imagined and well executed, if this bares any resemblence to horror gaming in the future, I wanna play! (Once the technology is tried and tested of course lol)9/10"
3,9, What a terrible episode!,1.0,"I thought Nosedive was bad, but PLAYTEST is even worse! And the main thing in common is in both episodes, I can't stand the main character. Nosedive starred Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron), while Playtest stars Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt and Goldie). Black Mirror should stick to actors who don't have famous parents from now on. Russell's character was too loud, abrasive, and obnoxious for me to root for him. I just didn't care about this guy. The episode itself was a bore. The first quarter was watching him travel around the world and get laid, then the chick he met on the dating app (only good character in this thing) sets him onto this virtual reality research facility that pays test volunteers to help develop their equipment. The man needs money because spent it all on his world tour. The segment is supposed to be a combination sci-fi horror story but there was very little of either. The ""horror"" was just a couple of jump scares and the sci-fi was barely seen. And other than that girl he hooked up with, the characters were bland. Russell's acting was way OTT and really bad in parts, the Saito guy's acting was bad, and his assistant was too monotone and kept distracting me with that stupid skirt that exposed her entire left leg. Who wears crap like that, especially at a place of business? Her incessant monotone was almost as bad as Russell's incessant yelling. These first 2 episodes of Season 3 were SO bad, I'm surprised at how utterly brilliant the rest of the season ended up being. How did this episode get rated so highly? Sad this and Nosedive are being lumped together with the remaining 4 episodes of Season 3, which are actually worthy of the Black Mirror tag. These first 2 are definitely not."
3,9, It absolutely blew my mind!,9.0,"I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish. Wyatt Russell delivered a powerhouse performance portraying the extremely likable protagonist. I found the concept to be quite relatable and really well-executed, although it's by no means new. The twists and turns are so effective. The way this episode ends sent shivers down my spine. The setup is a bit longer than it should be, though.I know this may be an unpopular opinion to have but this is my highest rated, and probably my favourite, Black Mirror episode I've seen so far.(9/10)"
3,9, Holographic Horror,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.The second episode of the third season of Black Mirror is titled ""Playtest"". The episode is directd by Dan Trachtenberg and is written by Charlie Brooker. The episode is about an American that becomes stranded overseas. Cooper, the marooned American, enters into a one-time playtest for a holographic videogame.Playtest is a story with a clean plot and setup. The episode relies a lot on the visuals and acting. They are up to par in this episode. It was great watching the episode play out as so much of the episode had great pacing that escalated the tension. This was felt as the episode moved on to explore the theme of horror.This episode is much more straightforward than earlier Black Mirror episodes. It is only at the end that the theme of personal horror becomes apparent. I enjoyed the slow reveal a lot as it reincorporated parts of the introduction. It also added more depth to the character of Cooper.The episode uses video games as more of a backdrop to explore the theme of horror. This was a good approach and lead to a fun episode. I would recommend ""Playtest"".Grade: B"
3,9, Am I high?,2.0,This episode makes me feel like I took something. And it was a bad trip. You never know what is going on. Its just a mess of all of his fears and in the end...its a pretty pointless and boring ending
3,9, Maybe the whole thing is a dream?,2.0,"That is really the only explanation for how a guy could stroll into town...start swiping right and immediately find a hottie. And he is ugly too...That would mean that she would have had to be on the app and had swiped right on him...but he just got there so she couldn't have,....THis was still more interesting than the entire rest of the episode.."
3,9," Wow , twist you mind on this .",9.0,"A great black mirror, super journey and a shattering black mirror ending. Read the small print when taking part in trials . And always phone ya mummy."
3,9, A very promising episode somewhat let down by the ending.,7.0,"Throughout the first three-quarters of the episode, I thought that it was going to be a home-run. A likable protagonist is established. He is thrown into an interesting new situation. Things get creepy and mysterious. Tension is built. By all accounts, this should have been great. But then, the last ten minutes really go completely off the rails. The ending is completely incomprehensible... though to call it an ending is a bit reductive since it is actually multiple endings layered within one another. Any one would have made sense and been satisfying on its own. But cobbled together as they are, it makes no sense and is tremendously disappointing. It feels like they wrote and filmed multiple endings and couldn't decide which one to go with so they just threw them all in.The episode follows an American near the end of his trip across Europe. In London, he accepts a one-off job play-testing revolutionary new technology from a major games developer. While the technology is successful, it may just be too successful..."
3,9, Scary Gaming Addiction,9.0,"This episode is a scary preview into the future of gaming addiction. It is a satire of gaming addiction, how literally deadly it can be. I even saw on a local news that a person died after continously playing for many hours. So this episode is really frightening."
3,9," Computer, end program",3.0,"Brooker clearly started with the last line and worked backwards. Sadly, what comes before doesn't justify the wag at the end of this shaggy dog story.The primary problem is that Hipster McDouchebag is an over-emoting superficial manchild with whom it's impossible to sympathise. I don't care about him, so I don't care about what happens to him. Why would I?Then there's the brain-simulation-gone-wrong plot, which is utterly hackneyed. It's been done before, repeatedly and better. This was a poor show from Brooker, and the self aware references don't excuse him looking backwards rather than forwards.The pacing is also badly done, with far too much irrelevant and uninvolving mundane filler in the back-story before we get to the near future payoff. Contrast with other Black Mirrors which make it immediately clear what the premise is going to be, and commit to it right from the first scene.Finally there's the whole tone of the piece proper, with an overblown score and too much shouting and arm waving - it's jarring and badly out of place in the Black Mirror oeuvre.If you like what makes Black Mirror great, you're not going to enjoy whatever this is. However, as usual, the True Believers have swamped IMDB with 10* shill ratings and reviews which makes it hard to get counter-point across. I hope that when they awake from their fantasy worlds that they'll realise what a poor decision that was."
3,10, Well worth your time...,9.0,"When the show begins, a teenage boy foolishly believes a pop-up on his computer when it tells him he has malware on his computer. He then installs something to supposedly fix it...but it actually implants a program on his computer activating his built-in camera. Now, unknown others are watching him as he goes through the internet.Soon, he begins receiving threatening messages on his computer. Apparently they could see him masturbating to photos on the web. They blackmail him to give them his phone number...and then the demands start coming. Soon, the boy is doing all sorts of things...that become more and more and more insane and dangerous as the show progresses. How bad is it and why he continues to comply are things you'll have to see for yourself.Unlike most of the other episodes I've seen on ""Black Mirror"", the technology to do what they did to the teen DOES exist today and the story is not sci-fi...they could easily do everything you see. Well written and obviously by a person who actually understands technology."
3,10, I Hated This,9.0,"I think the reason this is so good is that it shows what could happen to any of us. The boy chosen because of the camera on his laptop is an innocent. He is kind an a good worker. He's just a kid. He looks at some porn and masturbates, so the hackers (whoever they are--just a sick lot) record his actions and then use it to blackmail him into doing anything they want. He is not alone. Along the way, he meets several others who have suffered the same or similar fates. We watch the utter decline of this kid. One would hope when he is interrogated that he can tell his story. He has his phone to back up his story. But he has committed felonies, murder among them, and it will be hard to reclaim his innocence."
3,10, Dark Blackmail,9.0,"In London, Kenny (Alex Lawther) is a normal teenager that works in a fast-food and a beloved son and brother at home. When .his sister uses his notebook without permission, a malware is installed and he tries to remove it. But soon he is contacted by an unknown hacker that have recorded Kenny masturbating while watching a porno site using his webcam and blackmails him. Kenny receives instructions from the hacker and meet other people that are also forced to follows orders. He has to team up with Hector (Jerome Flynn), who is trying to save his marriage, and accomplish tasks with tragic consequences. ""Shut Up and Dance"" is one of the darkest episodes of ""Black Mirror"", with a tragic story of blackmail using the computer resources. Any computer has webcam and every second we have to be protected from virus and malware. Therefore the story is scary since it is possible to happen to anyone that uses a computer. The conclusion is frightening but predictable. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Shut Up and Dance"""
3,10, Every teenage boy's nightmare becomes mass carnage.,9.0,"Black Mirror has always managed to shock, horrify and get you to think, it's at its best when you say to yourself 'wow that could really happen,' and this is certainly one of those episodes. One minor action turns one young lads life upside down.After a few minutes in I thought the episode was pretty good, and after the initial incident I figured I was in for an interesting watch, but wow that was a twist and a half. It became darker, deeper and just downright more sinister with every scene. Tension was caused by minor things like Hector's friend asking for a lift. The fact that nobody knew why they were there or who was behind it made it all the more enjoyable.Ambiguity can be lazy in some shoes, things happening for no apparent reason, but the whole point of the anonymity of the miscreant here is that in this digital age, you have no idea who's behind things that go on.Awesome performances from everyone, I must take the opportunity to commend Jerome Flynn on his performance, he's become such a wonderful actor."
3,10," ""Tell no one. We are watching.""",8.0,"Notwithstanding the dubious motives and actions of Kenny (Alex Lawther) and Hector (Jerome Flynn), the unseen blackmailers are criminals who deserve to be exposed and tried for their crimes. They instigated a bank holdup and conspired in the deaths of innocent people. One might argue that none of the victims were 'innocent' or blameless, however their indiscretions were confined to their own individual selves and did not harm anyone outside of their sphere of influence. The only thing that might have done so was exposure by the blackmailers, which occurred regardless of how well Kenny and Hector performed their assignments. With technology, there arrives this slippery slope whereby unseen forces seemingly beyond the rule of law can operate without reprisal. The blackmailers deserve the White Bear treatment."
3,10, Gritty,8.0,"Shut Up and Dance grabs you by the throat and the seat of your pants and doesn't let go until the very end. This is back to form for Black Mirror, consistent with the grittiness of the seasons 1 and 2 on Channel 4. No pastel tones (Nosedive) in this one.Alex Lawther looks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and he nails the role big time.I was impressed by the locations, where we can really feel the cold and wet weather of England. It's high street for sure that's on display in this chilling episode of Black Mirror."
3,10, 6,6.0,"Well the idea is not original, plot was kind of interesting but I didn't get if you're masturbating in front of your pc camera by watching porn is that worse than robbing bank or killing person? It's really ridiculous. The ending was very predictable. So far worst episode from this season."
3,10, Uncomfortably powerful,8.0,"Unlike most, the episode ""Shut Up and Dance"" is not futuristic, but is based on existing technologies and their current abuses.An unknown person or group hacks computer cameras and catches people in compromising situations. Then uses these recordings to blackmail them. Several of these seemingly random victims have received obscure instructions on what, when, and where to do if they do not want their footage to leak to the public.The blackmailers' demands to the victims seem quite harmless in relation to the consequences if they do not fulfill them, but we see that only based on their reactions, while we do not really know what exactly they were blackmailed with. They depart each to his task, driven by panic fear of the publication of the images, which may seem irrationally excessive to us.The characters are ordinary people, totally inconspicuous and uninteresting, and the tasks themselves are quite banal and did not arouse my particular interest in the outcome, so I wondered why ""Shut Up and Dance"" has such a high rating on IMDb. A good idea of a perfect crime, where the actors are unknown and unrelated people, who don't even know what they're doing, so it's almost impossible to track them down, is spoiled by unimpressive characters and a pace that doesn't hold attention, but then these pieces of the puzzle begin to assemble into a broader picture and the tension begins to rise.When I finally figured out what it was about and my disappointment with the episode subsided, there was a final plot twist, which showed me that I hadn't figured anything out and that the real picture of this puzzle was much darker than I could have imagined. When the ending credits started, my wife and I sat for a while, silently glancing at each other with wtf expressions on our faces. The episode left us completely speechless. In the end, nothing was as it seemed and a day later I still don't know what to think.In technical terms, and even in acting, ""Shut Up and Dance"" is nothing spectacular, although Jerome Flynn, in one of the main roles, was a pleasant surprise to me. For the most part, the episode is not particularly atmospheric, and the tension is at a fairly low level for a thriller. But the impression that the final outcome left on me makes it perhaps the strongest episode so far. I can't recall the last time something has caused me this level of discomfort, which crawled into my bones and did not wane even later when the impressions settled.8,5/10."
3,10, Terrifying and thrilling.,9.0,"Black Mirror (4.5 out of 5 stars).Shut Up and Dance Episode 3.03Shut Up and Dance is a dark, twisted, and thrilling that takes the episode into a different direction in Black Mirror. The episode follows a couple of characters Kenny a teenager which his computer camera caught him in a act which some unknown person is messaging him and blackmailing him to do horrific acts. Hector is a character who is secretly having an affair and some unknown person is messaging him to do acts unless he wants his secret exposed to his wife.The plot is intense. It is horrifying because it can be relatable to real world situations with people computers being hacked and the camera can catch anything. And the person can blackmail another for their own personal gain. It is sad but true. Seeing Kenny and Hector panicked and nervous is emotionally scary and sad. There is a twist that can make you feel unease and disturbed. Without giving away much details. Alex Lawther was great playing Kenny. Jerome Flynn playing Hector was good too. They worked great on screen together.The story and concept is creepy and scary with the idea of a person being blackmailed and forced to do stuff that can break the law."
3,10, How Young Were They?,6.0,"I had mixed feelings throughout this episode.At first I was questioning why on earth the boy would allow himself to become embroiled in these highly dangerous games for simply doing something that's completely normal and natural. They do answer that question towards the end.I started to really like the episode during the middle portion, especially when the random lady at the gas station gets in the car. It built tension very well and became more exciting.Ultimately I don't feel completely satisfied with the ending:
throwing in the ""twist"" that he was looking at children feels somehow lazy and exploitativethe motivations of ""them"" are not properly explained, are they punishing bad people? It seems a bit over the top to ruin people's lives over some of these thingsMy gut just tells me that the ending was underwhelming. I feel like they are using this epic and emotive Radiohead song to try and achieve a feeling of deep revelation- I just don't think it's earned. It's all a little tacky and exploitative."
3,10, Ooffff,8.0,"This episode is a big oofff. The ending is really great, but the rest isn't the most engaging or intelligent. Still great."
3,10, Brilliant,10.0,"After a couple of truly dubious episodes Nosedive and Playtest that started Season 3, I think that this episode SHUT UP AND DANCE is really the first great episode of the season, and one of the best of the entire series, and jumpstarted what turned out to be an engrossing season. The main character of SUAD is Kenny (brilliantly played by Alex Lawther in a performance that should have won him a slew of awards). Kenny is an extremely shy, introverted 18-year old. Kenny lives a very mundane life, living at home with his mother and younger sister, and working at a fast food restaurant where he puts up with a couple of bullying co-workers as well as his manager, a girl who seems to rather fancy him.One day, Kenny is caught on video camera showing himself on the internet and is coerced into an elaborate blackmail scheme by mysterious cyber criminals who threaten to expose his dirty secret. The episode very methodically unravels their grand plan, as Kenny encounters several other blackmailees, most notably Hector (excellently played by Jerome Flynn), a middle-aged businessman who has a family he wants to protect from his secrets. SUAD is a brilliant, complex story that makes you think long after the episode is over. It makes you question who is the worst in this labyrinthine situation. The hackers or the secret-keepers? The acting by all, even minor roles, is pitch perfect. But all kudos should go to the aforementioned Lawther, who makes Kenny a very real human being who got caught up in something beyond his control."
3,10, Traumatic!,9.0,"As spine-tingling as it is heart-rending, Shut Up and Dance justifies Black Mirror's misanthropic perspective in a most harrowing way. It's now my favorite Black Mirror episode so far!(9/10)"
3,10, Enthralling pace,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.""Shut Up and Dance"" is the third episode in the third season of Black Mirror. The episode is directed by James Watkins and witten by Charlie Brooker and William Bridges. A teenager named Kenny is blackmailed by hackers that force him to follow a series of instructions.""Shut Up and Dance"" is an incredibly tight paced episode. Right from the beginning the audience is dragged into Kenny's plight. The episode follows Kenny almost the entire time in the 52 minutes of running time. We watch him in progressively brutal situations that the blackmailers force him into. The audience gets to see how these characters are blackmailed to begin with. It makes the story much more exciting as the central mystery is a solid.This episode is surprisingly grounded in reality. It can be plausible for a situation like this to occur in today's surveilled and online society. This does make the reality of the situation more horrifying as events like this can take place. The ground in reality added a lot to the story and it made the episode much more enjoyable.I would recommend ""Shut Up and Dance"".Grade: A"
3,10, what was the point of all that?,1.0,"take this series away from the British crew because they go and churn out incoherent messes like this that meander about then just sort of end.hackers or something gather shady info on a bunch of different people, then put them all through an elaborate, pointless scheme, then seem to lose interest or run out of ideas and just leak all the stuff anyway. mass trollface text message appears to dismiss it all as being for the lulz.maybe i'm just lacking in empathy as I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters"
3,10, Poor Kenny ?,10.0,"Here is a classic 10/10 black mirror mind twisting journey that deserves your attention.A must watch , cant give much detail without spoiler but this is a classic."
3,10," Has some great tension, though it lacks a clear message.",9.0,"I don't really get what the message of this episode is. I suppose that it serves as a sort of cautionary tale for the use of computers, but it lacks the biting satire and moral questions that previous seasons of Black Mirror have had. Also, the ending felt a little bit random to me. However, despite the fact that the story appears to have little point, it is a very well told story. It is tense, gripping, and will keep you guessing until the end. It may have been one of the most enjoyable episodes of the season for me, even if I find some aspects of it to be objectively weak.The episode is about a teen who is hacked and then blackmailed into doing increasingly crazy things. It is not a particularly original story, but it is well told. The intensity builds nicely throughout."
3,10, Cover Your Cameras,10.0,"This episode is the scariest, since nowadays it is very possible to happen. Invasion of privacy is very scary and creepy.The story is both suspenseful and horrifying, the acting of the main lead is simply fantastic. The reveal that he's a pedophile...really shocking. Going back to that scene where he gave back the toy to that girl...creepy."
3,10," ""Shut up and WHOAaa what the hell?! Most depressing hour of television I've ever seen!""",9.0,"This is how you make a short story. From the beginning the watcher is intrigued and keeps watching as the story builds up suspense. The acting is amazing and really sets the whole tone for the episode. My one problem with it is probably the amount of talking, which might seem stupid as there isn't much, but without it the watcher would make up there own mind about what is happening and it would make it that bit more impactful, maybe just tell the older man to quieten down a bit. The ending is sooooo good and is so satisfying yet unsatusfying. It is such a relief to finally understand what was truly going on but left me in shock about the incredible twist. INCREDIBLE WRITING>>>TRES GOOD."
3,10, This is So Fu**in' Realistic!,9.0,"At First- No hyper Technology used inside this episode, like all other episodes in Black Mirror. It is Just Today's World and Today's Technology!
2nd Thing is- Very Engaging Plot. And the Acting performances of Alex (Kenny) and Hector (who was Bronn in Game of Thrones) both did tremendous job here. Especially Kenny and his Acting and Emotions are Luv to watch according to this storyline.
3rd and Most Important Thing- ''Message''
Ohh Yeah! This Episode definitely gives us a lesson that how far a human can go to maintain their good shining image in this society, and how much our Daily uses Gadgets (Like Mobile Phone, Computers etc.) Are SAFE,in terms of Privacy!
In fact I listened Mark Zuckerberg Hides his Front Camera of Computer with the Stickers!
""Everyone Should Follow It"".
I will definitely go for 9 Stars Out of 10 because it's so fu**in' Realistic episode and Close to reality! It's better to avoid watching with family, for your safety concerns! ha ha Joking!"
3,10, Great thriller with extra-disturbing ending,8.0,"Unoriginal episode focused on cyberbullying. However, the plot is dynamic, intense atmosphere and acting performances are phenomenal. Besides the danger of online predators the episode doesn't say much, but the jaw-dropping, horrifying twist sent shivers down my spine."
3,10, the internet,10.0,"Now we all know that you can not be safe on internet no matter what.
But truth to be told you need to be careful to protect yourself and your data from being robbed and used against your own will.The twisted plot of this episode is amazing and there are some points that makes you wonder all the time why."
3,11, Very hard to describe without revealing too much...,8.0,"This episode of ""Black Mirror"" is one that might offend you. After all, it talks about a lot of things that a conservative sort of person might object to seeing...bisexuality, lesbianism as well as a euthanasia. It is also a very challenging episode to watch...so have a few Kleenex handy just in case.As far as explaining the episode goes, that is very problematic. Part of it is because it's a very complicated episode indeed. But most is that if I tell you much it will spoil the suspense. Suffice to say it's about a relationship that is forged by two women living in a 1980s like place called San Junipero. What else? Just see the show.The show is well made but more importantly very original...well worth seeing as well.By the way, I was impressed how they were able to hide the fact they filmed this episode in Cape Town, South Africa. I've spent a lot of time in this amazing city and realize they had to take great care to avoid showing some of the iconic things there, such as the giant Table Mountain as well as folks driving non-American cars on the left side!"
3,11, What Would You Do?,8.0,"This is a touching episode. But there are some shortcomings. I agree with the reviewer who said that given the opportunities that they had, why did they choose to do so little. Partying, having sex, and driving around in sports cars. I wonder if there are other realities, or do all the people pretty much live in that place for eternity. A clever bit is how the technology changes over time. The bond between the two main characters is fine, but I found them rather dull. But the concept is quite intriguing, even if it isn't pulled off perfectly."
3,11, Beautiful and Sensitive,9.0,"""San Junipero"" is one of those films where it is not possible to write a synopsis without spoilers. The direction and the screenplay are amazing and sensitive, with magnificent performances of Gugu Mbatha-Raw, in the role of an independent party girl, and Mackenzie Davis, in the role of a shy woman with nerd appearance. The lesbian love story is beautiful, subtle and delicate and never offensive. But the plot point is fantastic and unexpected. ""Black Mirror"" usually has dark conclusions but ""San Junipero"" is the first episode with an optimistic happy ending with a wonderful view of death. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""San Junipero"""
3,11," A love story that transcends the ages, beautiful",9.0,"I had seen the astonishing reviews, and had very high expectations for this episode, and I was not disappointed. It was absorbing, engaging, emotional, beautifully acted, and had a very deep message about love. I do love a love story, but when it comes to Black Mirror I like the darker stories, I couldn't put San Junipero at the top of my list for that reason, but still it is a fabulous watch. The pacing and delivery of the story was amazing, you were slowly given what was going on, and the ending, once reached seemed inevitable. Beautifully acted, visually stunning, and as for that music! A true indication of how amazing music was back then, one of the reason why the Eighties has become such a fashionable era to visit. Bravo San Junipero."
3,11," ""This is not for fun, okay?""",8.0,"It's uncanny how the episodes of Black Mirror start out one way and end in a completely different direction. 'San Junipero' took on the theme of 'immersive nostalgia therapy' to tell the story of two disparate individuals who discover each other and come to share a uniquely blessed experience. The writing once again is simply brilliant and it wasn't difficult half way into the story to actually care about Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis), even if their full stories hadn't been fully revealed yet. This story doesn't fit the traditional Black Mirror mold, but I think by this point in the series that becomes a welcome break from the dark, dystopian feel of prior episodes. It's a mind expanding journey into the light that's worth the effort and a story to be savored with repeat viewings."
3,11, A masterpiece. Raw and Davis own this but it's affecting story first,10.0,"I should be bothered by the lack of explanations on things - at first- but I was not. The science and technology and futurism is there, but it is not fully about that. The science fiction is the backdrop and everything else is about character and mood, how one gets ready for a night to go out in the 80!s, how one feels close to the other and how connections get formed. The writers can make this be affecting even if the science is questionable (and it isn't). These women are amazing together, and how they jump in time feels like this is something RIchard Matheson could have written (ala Somewhere in Time). Their total connection to each other, the rawness and vulnerability and strength of their acting, it rides over logic. It's the HEAVEN IS NOW of Black Mirror episodes (look it up, it's worth it).As the story goes on it only increases and gets deeper, the ramifications of what we do with our time, where our lives take us, how the choices and the partners we choose take us along in life. So much is given to us in an hour as far as what goes into these lifetimes that go from the 1980s into.... The future.  It has three distinct acts and it so builds to an overwhelming point. While Black Mirror is often good at crafting memorable relationships, this is a story that gives us two people - entities, hearts, lives where being no sexual means hearts are given to others and everything Kelly says in a moment of anger has validity - and it's so well drawn and complex. I will need to watch it again. When will Charlie Kaufman write for Black Mirror?"
3,11, Charlie Brooker's ode to Hallmark,7.0,"Definitely no prime ministers and pigs in this episode (The National Anthem), with a nice warm feel in this sentimental episode filmed in London and South Africa. This episode drew the ire of several low iMDB user reviews because of it's pro-LGBTI stance, but it's also acclaimed by critics and numerous viewers alike.The ending is very touching. I wonder if Hallmark will option the rights to this episode for a full-length movie.I love the 80s songs, and this episode alone could have a soundtrack for sale (vinyl of course)."
3,11, 10,10.0,"Totally astonished. This episode showing life after life which is going to be in near future in real life I believe. Plot was really interesting, it was the happiest ending in 3seasons so far which made me really blest. Those songs OMG turned me back to my childhood. 10/10. That's what I call masterpiece nothing to take, nothing to add. Just perfection."
3,11," ""Sounds like Heaven""",9.0,"""Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like Heaven.""The coastal town of San Junipero, in the eighties of the last century. Saturday night, the streets are full of young people visiting nightclubs. Sexually charged atmosphere, cult music hits, but there is also some discomfort in the air, which reminded me of ""The Streets of Fire"".The story of two women, two worlds, who, with turbulence, find themselves in each other. This, one might say, typical romantic drama does not seem to fit into the ""Black Mirror"" series at all. Any further delving into the story would lead to unforgivable spoilers, so I will have to let you discover for yourself why ""San Junipero"" is not only a worthy representative of this top series, but also one of its best episodes.In every aspect, the authors made an effort to conjure up the production style of the eighties, my favorite decade in film and music, so the nostalgia may have clouded my objectivity a bit. Camera, directing, acting, music, I loved it all. The plot twist is great and, although I predicted it, I don't think it's too predictable in itself, it's just on my wavelength. It certainly did not spoil my impression, because I experienced it as a fulfillment of a wish, and not as a spoiled surprise.Spoiler alert!Only the very ending was quite over-the-top. As much as I am glad for the happy ending, because I was really attached to the main characters, this same happy ending is unnaturally imposed here and it seems forced. Also, it is not in the spirit of the series. If they had finished the episode a bit earlier, it would have been much better.9/10."
3,11, Interesting and mindbending.,10.0,"Black MirrorSan Junipero (5 out of 5 stars).San Junipero is the fourth episode in the third season Black Mirror. This episode is fantastic. It is mind bending and throws some interesting concepts which I will not give away spoilers. The best you watch without knowing about it the better. The idea of Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) and Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) meeting at a club in San Junipero to have a time of their lives. While every week, they meet at a new time era or different locations.The episode does let you question a lot about life after death. And the reality of how one can tell or not. The episode was amazing. The cinematography was great and captured great shots in every scene. The music score and soundtrack that portrayed the decades era from the 80s, 90s, and 00s was just fantastic. Even the background settings of the arcade of having the classic games like Pac man, Time Crisis, and House of the Dead. Does deliver the nostalgia feeling. The script and direction is sharp. The twist is mind bending and great."
3,11, Style over Substance,5.0,"Ok. A Black Mirror episode with a ""happy"" ending? I dunno about that.I don't feel we really got a good enough insight into why these characters would fall into an eternal love for each other. I never felt like I emotionally connected with their journeys. It all felt very melodramatic and soap opera-esque.They wanted to throw in a bunch of 80s music to make it aesthetically pleasing - but that tends to steal the focus away from the actual drama of the story.Everything felt a bit predictable. There was no AHA moment or big reveal."
3,11, Two puzzling issues,5.0,"In this episode, the elderly can ""upload"" a younger version of themselves to ""paradise"" and continue living, even after their physical death.Clearly a debatable concept, albeit very intriguing. Two of the main points discussed by other reviewers: the idea of paradise as partying in a tropical resort and the ""happy ending"".1) why disapprove the idea of a tropical beach resort and partying as paradise? What exactly would be an alternative? Providing healthcare and social assistance? No need for that... also, having fun without hurting anybody is not a bad way to spend time. Besides, nobody would prevent your ""soul"" from engaging with more intellectual endeavours.2) I found the Yorkie character passive-aggressive, as shown by the reckless decision she took in her youth. Yorkie likes to force the hand of those around her and that is not a pleasant feature. Kelly is a more sympathetic character, but her decision to have some fun before passing is twarted by the whiny, aggressive Yorkie.The ""happy ending"" looks sort of temporary, as Kelly would probably want to party a bit more, but Yorkie might turn into a clingy wet blanket - not even paradise guarantees happines, when you are stuck with the wrong person.PS and who would want to be a bartender in paradise? I thought the point was one will not need to work..."
3,11, A Television Masterpiece!,10.0,"San Junipero easily fits the bill of what anthology television always strives to do: make immortal pieces of work stand out from the crowd while still being part of a collective series of equally captivating works. San Junipero evokes Thelma and Louise, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and also being infused with that good old 80s nostalgia that's had a television resurgence thanks to Stranger Things. Oh; and PacMan is referenced too.This is a lovely capsule of nostalgia, romance, what the afterlife could be like in the future (in a cloud containing people's minds), and how this episode also says there's no shame in 'coming out', especially in this day and age where LGBT people are being seen as 'threatening' to conservatives even though there's no harm at all in choosing that lifestyle openly.As far as Black Mirror episodes go, this one surprised me the most solely because it actually moved me the most. I love the series as a whole, but damn this episode was truly an experience! An episode that gets 5/5 stars from me."
3,11, Quite possibly the most brilliant hour of television I have ever seen,10.0,"I wouldn't normally write about a single episode of a TV show, but this incredible composition- set in the midst of an almost cacotopian alternate reality- has to be one of the most beautiful, sincere and heart-breaking love stories ever told."
3,11, Exceptional Storytelling!,7.0,"This episode has the most unique storytelling technique I've seen in anything before .... for better or worse! The way the plot unravels is simply unprecedented, but that doesn't mean it's flawless. Everything begins to make sense in the second half until we get to the end and then I realized how genius the concept is. However, this came at the expense of the first half which, although it couldn't get more technically impressive, was perfunctory, unjustifiably confusing, and most of all, boring .... at least for me!(7.5/10)"
3,11, High optimism,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.""San Junipero"" is the fourth episode in the third season of Black Mirror. The episode is directed by Owen Harris and written by Charlie Brooker. The episode is set during the 1980s in a town named San Junipero. The episode focuses on the relation between Yorkie and Kelly.""San Junipero"" is an incredibly optimistic episode of Black Mirror. This episode features a technology where the elderly characters in the episode can live out a life in the 1980s that exists in the cloud. This episode features a use of technology that is portrayed as optimistic. The use of uploading people into the cloud allows the characters to actually live out their lives without regrets. This episode contrasted well with the bleak episodes of earlier Black Mirror episodes.""San Junipero"" features great direction and the faux 1980s style being used to great effect. This episode is among one of the best directed and produced Black Mirror episodes. The acting by the two lead characters are also great as well. The setting for this episode is not only used for convenience and it plays into the plot's writing. Yorkie's revelation that she had become crippled after coming out makes sense if it had happened in the 1980s. It also made her acceptance of the technology completely understandable.The ending of this episode is incredibly hopeful for the use of technology to allow broken characters a chance. I would recommend the fourth episode of the third season ""San Junipero"".Grade: B"
3,11, The chemistry between the actors is the episode's saving grace.,7.0,"The problem with this episode is that it is too long. It waits too long to reveal the twist, and then draws things out too much afterwards. It could have told the same story in less time and been more effective. As it is, it really starts to drag. Just because Netflix allowed them to make the episode and hour long doesn't mean they should have. The episode has an interesting enough story, it is just stretched beyond its logical length. As a result, I liked the episode far less than I should have. The actors have great chemistry. I really felt invested in the relationship that was built between them.The episode is set in San Junipero, a party town in the 80's. A shy girl is there on vacation when she goes into a bar and meets another girl. That is the plot of the entire first half of the episode. Then there is a twist, and the plot picks up a bit, but still moves quite slowly."
3,11, Very Touching,9.0,"I started watching this episode and had absolutely no clue what was going on. It was different from all the other episodes of Black Mirror and seemed to be revolving around a love story. It felt boring at first, but once it's revealed what is actually going on, I felt it was a brilliant portrayal of love, lost youth, and yearning. Compared to the darker and sometimes disturbing previous episodes, I thought this was beautiful. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Beautifully shot and acted. Just wonderful to watch."
3,11," After Waldo, this one is boring too",5.0,"One of the boring episode of Black Mirror, I guess they must did this to please the minority. So this one is like running from the black mirror's main theme that exist to show how technology affect human. This one? Its just a love story between outgoing girl and a nerd, girl. Thanks hollywood."
3,11, Sweetest episode,10.0,"San Junipero is an eccentric love story. It begins in the 1980s in a beautiful small town, where two young women meet in a bar and fall in love. But that's not it. I love the production design. It looked like an authentic 1980s movie. The acting of the two female leads are amazing. The story is by far the most emotional and touching one since Be Right Back."
3,11, This episode is so good it may well have been a movie!,10.0,"Everything about this episode was just amazing. I'm a black mirror fan but compared to a last few episodes this was simply mind- blowing. I kept wondering how this is not a movie. I mean it has the production quality, script, acting, sci-fi elements of a movie like ""Her"". The presentation is also very interesting and keeps you guessing what is happening all along. What's most interesting about this episode is that apart from a simple love story, it also contains deep questions about what happens when you enter a world where you have access to everything and you can control everything, i.e. when sex, money, and all the worldly things become immaterial. Do you still get pleasure from dressing up, hookups, orgies, etc? Or is true love the only important thing that remains when you can live for eternity and worldly things don't matter. Brilliant concept and execution... hats off!"
3,11, Beautifully different,9.0,"San Junipero is quite different than the other BM episodes. The plot and characters are somewhat stereotypical, but the rest of the episode makes up for it.The episode focuses on death, mourning and after-life (from both the classical and technological perspective). Although I knew the ""twist"" before, the episode was still very enjoybale. Acting is good, the 80's atmosphere is top-notch (great soundtrack - Heaven Is a Place on Earth).While other Black Mirror episodes are always depressing in some way, San Junipero shines thanks to its uniqueness and optimism."
3,11, TCKR,9.0,How to escape life to live for eternity that's the question that all humans are trying to deceive.But I believe that death is a beautiful thing.
3,12," Very disturbing...and if they COULD do this, I bet they would....",10.0,"Although it's from season three, this is the first episode I saw of ""Black Mirror""...and considering how good it is, it was a good place to start.The show is set in the near future. Soldiers from some sort of international armed forces unit are battling 'roaches', though the roaches aren't bugs but people...or they are kinda people. While they are humanoid, their mouths are freaking and inhuman and so is their language. They are very scary looking...and the soldiers know it's only proper that these 'things' are wiped out once and for all. The problem is that one of the soldiers is having problems with his implants...and they all receive some sort of implants...and where this goes is what makes this one memorable and exciting to watch.This show has a lot to say...but I don't want to discuss this now since you may not have seen the show and talking about the implants would ruin the suspense. Suffice to say, the show is clever and a bit of a scare since it seems possible such horrible technology COULD one day be created."
3,12, The Military Mind,7.0,"I truly believe that the most money and direction in most political entities is to give carte blanche to something military. Since survival is the most basic human emotion, we tend to want anything that facilitates that. When we talk about the advancement of culture, education, agriculture, infrastructure, the amount of money given to these is piddly compared to the military. And I'm talking about most countries in the world, not just ours. Think of Syria and Russia and northern African nations. I believe that if the kind of technology existed that was portrayed in this episode, there would be a group of zealots that would embrace it lovingly. Get rid of inferiority in our genetic make-up. The ""Roaches"" are just people with imperfections (as we all have) like possible cancer. Anyway, this is a really disturbing episode because it is possible. Hitler used the same premises that these guys did. Throw in religion, which is equally dangerous because it preaches its own superiority, and you've got the seeds of the worst kind of world."
3,12, The Future Soldier,8.0,"In a post-apocalyptic near future, soldiers using implants that enhances their senses and provide data of their missions are fighting mutants called Roaches. When the squad of the rookie ""Stripe"" is assigned to help villagers that had their supplies stolen by roaches, they learn that they have head to the house of a farmer. The soldiers find a hideout of roaches and kill them. However one of the creatures points a device to Stripe but he is killed by the soldier. Soon his implant glitches every now and then and he is submitted to a medical examination and visits a psychologist and learns that he does not have any problem. On his next assignment, Stripe, Medina and Rai are assigned to another mission and Medina is killed by a sniper. Stripe and Rai enter in the building to hunt down the sniper. But soon Stripe learns the truth about the roaches and the purpose of the implants.""Men Against Fire"" is a scary view of the use of technology by the Lords of War in the warfare. Today it may be still fiction, but the way this industry is developing, it might be possible some interface to control and improve the soldiers' feelings and senses. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Men Against Fire"""
3,12, Intensely disturbing.,9.0,"Men against Fire is a classic episode of Black Mirror, it has so many things going for it, but for me, it's the what if scenario posed by the episode that's most impactful. It asks the terrifying question, what if the Military could command what soldiers saw? What if they had the ability to remove free will. It is a terrifying scenario, removing conscience from the military.Malachi Kirby and Michael Kelly are both incredible, Kirby injects a life, a compassion and a sense of awareness into his performance, he in particular was superb.Easy to follow, despite dealing with complex subjects, it never feels too clever for its own good. Very well made indeed, superb production values, as always.Powerful, hard hitting drama 9/10."
3,12," ""Mass lets you do it.""",8.0,"In the story, they call it 'Mass' - an implant that screens out all distractions to war and the killing task at hand. Soldiers will not be sidelined by the sights, sounds and smells of war, death and killing. What startled me, and I don't know if it's true or not until I research it, was Arquette's (Michael Kelly) explanation that during World War I and II, only fifteen to twenty percent of Allied soldiers ever fired their weapons, and in many of those instances, over the heads of the enemy. That was just a stunning revelation. So the effort to desensitize soldiers by removing inhibitions seems like a logical step. All very frightening, because it makes the art of killing even more removed from human consideration. And yet in the scenario offered to Stripe (Malachi Kirby), he was allowed a choice to mind-wipe himself again or relive the horror of hunting roaches. The failure of the episode lies in it's inability to explain why the 'roaches' appear as vampires but the Danish citizens in the countryside being terrorized by them appear normal. How does the Mass implant distinguish between the two?"
3,12," War, what is it good for?",6.0,"This is a deep episode that questions the morality of war, and whether a war can be a ""good one"". This episode doesn't rank highly amongst the Black Mirror fans, but it has a very serious tone that seeks to get the audience pondering about how the good guys see the bad ones. What is right? What is wrong? What are the grey areas?"
3,12, 5,5.0,"Very bland episode with basic plot, nothing interesting, whole hour full of lack action."
3,12," The weakest in the season, or more precisely, the least good",7.0,"Another futuristic episode, judging by the language, is located in Denmark, in a military base that trains super-soldiers with brain implants, to hunt for mutants that threaten the survival of the human race. But when one of the soldiers' implant breaks down, he begins to realize that he is living a lie and that things are not as they seemed.The fact is that this episode does not bring the original story, but is a fairly faithful copy of the 1998 episode ""Hearts and Minds"" of the series ""The Outer Limits"". But we certainly live in an era of remakes and reboots, accustomed to a serious shortage of original ideas, and personally, I have never had a problem with loans of this type, if the result is quality.""Men Against Fire"" sticks to the basic idea of the ""Black Mirror"" series and brings us another possible abuse of modern technologies in the near future. It criticizes war propaganda and brainwashing, as well as the tendency of an individual to, although enlightened, side with the majority and opt for a line of least resistance.The episode is an SF drama, with horror influences and the inevitable plot twist. It is well filmed and acted, and the horror moments are effective. However, previous episodes have raised my criteria to a fairly high level, with which ""Men Against Fire"" fails to keep up. Even if I hadn't watched ""The Outer Limits"", the story didn't bring me anything new and it didn't manage to interest me in the characters and their destinies, and the general atmosphere, compared to the rest of the series, was lukewarm.7/10."
3,12, Predictable but good.,8.0,"Black MirrorMen Against Fire (4 out of 5 stars).This episode delivers another mind bending story with a social commentary message hidden in the theme. Which can try to be relatable to the real world political/ warfare theme. It has an interesting plot without trying to give much away about the twist. I did find the twist to be predictable with this one. The plot follows Stripe (Malachi Kirby) and Hunter (Madeline Brewer) who are in a military squad. Preparing to exterminate ""roaches"" which is mutated infected people. While Stripe begins to have visions during the mission. Which there can be something more that is hidden in there mission.It has a sharp entertaining direction. As the squad is walking through a wasteland of an apocalyptic future. I thought the twist has been done before in another science fiction movie which is interesting but predictable."
3,12, Eugenics Pick N Mix,6.0,"OkAt first I thought it was a pretty unoriginal take on a zombie movie, which it kind of is. The twist is simply that the ""zombies"" are just people with bad genetic traits. I was actually really enjoying the story for the first half or so.A better twist for the episode would have been to have the device show the roaches as normal people - when in fact they really do have a dangerous contagious sickness, and it turns out the military are actually justifiable in their actions. At least then it would give the viewer something to think about. As it stands, it's completely obvious from the start that the roaches will turn out to be innocent people.As another reviewer mentioned, history and the present day continue to show us that certain humans need no excuses to oppress others and visit violence upon other people who are different. The idea that a human would only kill another human if they resemble a literal monster is absurd to the point of farce - completely divorced from the reality of the world and human nature. A regime can always find violent thugs ready to get out there and guiltlessly follow orders.The eugenics angle seems a little silly. If they had the blood results for these undesirables, why would they be eliminating them in such a haphazard way? Why wouldn't they take care of them at the time of the testing? It's possible I misunderstood the nature of the testing, or that they only decided later on to exterminate these people, or that they somehow escaped. I guess the bloodwork results wouldn't be instant. This version of administering eugenics just comes off as goofy.It just seems odd to me that if the elites decided to exterminate these ""inferior"" people, that they would do it in such a bizarre way. The logic is that they want future generations to inherit good traits, but the world the ""normal"" villagers are living in looks crummy as hell anyway. It doesn't seem to me like they are caring about quality of life for the ""normal"" people, so why would they care so much if they got some bad genes? Wouldn't it make more sense for the well bred powerful people just to isolate themselves away from the undesirables?The ideas of fascism and eugenics are completely unoriginal- to the point that the villain comes off as a one dimensional moustache Twirler. For this episode to be compelling you need to be able to sympathise with the villain in some way.It really just feels like this world is unrealistic and the episode didn't do a great job of explaining the logic of the world."
3,12, The weakest episode so far,2.0,"I am following the series in chronological order and so far, I found something interesting in each episode. Unfortunately, this story is just a banal politically correct statement.It is based on the unrealistic premises that human beings are too sympathetic a species to inflict pain willingly. However, history constantly proves that men are quite eager to hurt others.Being it fuelled by ideological or tribal reasons, or just pure sadism, there is no shortage of violence in our past (and present). You just need to check the torture instruments invented throughout the centuries (and still used nowadays), to understand that no brainwashing is required to convince somebody to hurt someone else.Perhaps it does take some natural inclination, but not much convincing.. and if during WWII only 20% of soldiers actually aimed at the enemy, how come 70 million people died? Did they purposely stumble on bullets?Anyway, the plot is about a marine brainwashed by a cybernetic device called MASS into killing people with defective DNA - though it is not clear why somebody against violence would join the marines to start with....PS and if the authors wanted to make a powerful statement, maybe they should have considered religious brainwashing instead of the military - which has been done way too many times before. But I guess that would have been way too controversial and Black Mirror stops short of controversy."
3,12, Coulda been better!,7.0,"In the grand scheme, it's very generic, to say the least. But some revalations at the last act proved it has some nuances that are enough to make it mildly refreshing, and kinda smart, at its core. It was all about the execution itself that saved the best, the meat of the story, for the last, and utilized it as a plot-twist rather than building upon it.(7/10)"
3,12, Heavy handed,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.The fifth episode of the third season of Black Mirror is entitled ""Man Against Fire"". The episode is directed by Jakob Verbruggen and written by Charlie Brooker. The episode stars Malachi Kirby as Stripe, a soldier in the military. Stripe is forced to confront his past actions after a successful raid against mutants.The episode is absolutely heavy handed in the delivery of its message. The episode has MASS implants creating illusions of mutated creatures such that Stripe and his squad annihilate them. The episode does not have much subtlety in the execution of the concept. It became apparent as the episode went on that the plot attempts this as a twist. The plot of this episode is still engaging. The plots suspense is not as engaging as the direction.The acting by Malachi Kirby deserves mention. He does a fantastic job with the role and it certainly shows on the screen. Likewise, the other supporting actors play up to par. The episode is not weak in the acting or direction.Despite the lack of surprise in the plot I still enjoyed ""Man Against Fire"". The episode is a solid addition to Black Mirror. I would recommend ""Man Against Fire"".Grade: B"
3,12, unique take on common trope,7.0,"neat stuff, sick. not possible to properly review episode without spoilers, as tends to be the case with the series. The topic for this week is genetic engineering, eugenics, genetic diseases, and that sort of thing, probably most famously covered in science fiction by the movie ""Gattaca"".the initial conceit is what may be some manner of minor post-apocalypse, in which soldiers with combat-enhancing implants hunt down and kill shrieking deformed monster-people called ""Roaches"". Then one of them hits the protagonist with an electronic tube with green lights, and stuff starts changing for him.the big reveal is that there are no ""Roaches"", at least in terms of what the soldiers see; their implants directly affect their cognition (all their senses, not just sight) so that they see designated people they have to kill as shrieking monsters. they are actually killing normal civilian people who are ""genetically inferior"", pre-disposed to genetic deformations, diseases, illnesses, mental disorders, that sort of thing.rather than handle the situation in a soft bigotry type of way like in ""Gattaca"" (where these types of people are tolerated but essentially second-class citizens) or trying to gently exterminate this via eugenics programs, the people in this episode have gone a seemingly overly complicated path to exterminate people with inferior genes, while also fixing the supposed ""problem"" of soldiers in war being hesitant to kill their enemies, ending up going out of their way to avoid actually hitting their opponent.by literally dehumanizing their opponent, the soldiers can kill their enemies mercilessly with no lingering effects of PTSD or combat fatigue or mercy to their enemies.while an interesting conceit, the execution seems troubled, with it taking just a bit too long and in a roundabout way to get to the big reveal, and then having to have it all explained in two separate Expo Dump monologues that end up leaving a small window of interesting self-reflection followed by heaping portions of fridge logic that linger long afterwards. Some of the major issues that you think up later; 1) Only the soldiers have the implant which makes genetic inferiors look like ""Roaches"". Thus, the other civilians in the area know that the ""Roaches"" are normal people who are infected. It seems highly likely that there would be a lot more people than the one supposedly crazy religious man hiding ""Roaches"" in their homes and keeping them safe, and that interactions between the soldiers and the civilians would eventually lead to the realization by one side or another that the ""Roaches"" aren't actually monsters.2) The episode does a great job of avoiding any significant Nazi parallels, but I cannot imagine this situation they have of implanting soldiers to make them see the enemy as monsters would be universally accepted among all nations and/or fighting forces. It would seem that having one nation and/or one army going around mass murdering civilians in a European country they deem to be ""genetically inferior"" would not be a situation that would escape notice of other countries, who would most likely end up eventually uniting and attacking them to stop them.3) Given the level of technology they have, it would be utterly impossible to keep something like this a secret."
3,12," With a great thought provoking premise and smart execution, Men Against Fire is one of Black Mirror's best",9.0,"Right now, this and Be Right Back are head and shoulders above all other BM episodes for me (with 9 still to watch). I really loved this one. It's an exciting plot with a great twist that makes perfect sense, and has a rich ambiguous message. In varying ways it gets at government propaganda, the psychological effects of war, human nature, and the difficulty of resistance. Extremely well executed, and the ambiguous ending is fantastic. We know what his decision is - but what do his tears represent? Also dope to see my girl Shiv (Sarah Snook) here. This is a really great episode with much more complex and compelling moral considerations than many episodes of the show."
3,12, The season's most thought-provoking episode,7.0,"To me, this episode felt more like an episode of Black Mirror than any other this season. The thing I like most about this series is the way that it makes me ask myself ethical questions that I never would have thought about otherwise while I'm watching. It brings up the topic of morality relative to near future technology. That is what has been in some ways lacking from this season... until this episode. Admittedly, the episode is a little bit heavy-handed at times, a little predictable at others. But at least it was working with big ideas, putting them out there, and making me think. For that reason and that reason alone, I liked it more than any other this season.The episode follows future soldiers as they hunt down and kill genetically inferior ""roaches"" in some part of Europe. The subjects of eugenics, consent, and propaganda in the modern age are all brought into question by the episode."
3,12, Other reviews make me quiver,8.0,"First and foremost, this is a good episode, just like the rest of the Black Mirror series.To cut an extremely long and complicated story short (no sarcasm, honest) the military hypnotises (potentially implants too) voluntary recruits to the armed forces. This ensures they are viewing the human race (the damaging, disease ridden, destructive race that we are) as mutants that need to be destroyed before they destroy ""us"". It's a well planned out episode but merely telling a story we're more than accustomed to. Delete the lesser, power on with the stronger of the species (Hitler anyone? No?)Anyway, the episode culminates after the main guy gets shone in the eyes by a laser which the ""roaches"" (also known as human beings) had constructed to help soldiers see the real them. He starts to realise and rebel resulting in a showdown with the mastermind of the project. He's given an option, continue to live in a world where he'll be hunted or be the hunter and he'll forget everything he's seen thus far.The episode ends with his (presumably dead) wife running out to greet him after being dropped off at a now derelict home, which due to a quick flashback shows it used to be beautiful.The ending is open to opinion, but I think it's more than apparent (and more apparent than some of the other explanations I've read on here) that she'd been deemed a ""roach"" and subsequently killed by the him and the military, hence his constant torture throughout the episode.Enjoy and I hope you make similar sense."
3,12, It's been done before,1.0,"I'm giving this a one star because it's essentially a rip-off of a story from The Outer Limits and isn't original. In TOL episode there are people fighting each other who regularly take a drug because of ""radiation"", when in fact it alters their perception of the enemy so they look like monsters. One soldier ends up not getting the drug and sees the ""monsters"" for what they are - real people - but cannot convince his friends that they have been manipulated into fighting other humans, not alien monsters. So the story line is exactly the same."
3,12," Good ideas, but poor presentation and execution.makr this a poor episode for Black Mirror",6.0,"The episode begins rather strong. It made me interested in the protagonist and the overall arc. But they present too many clues for me to be surprised by the twists.The content feels spoon-fed rather than particularly intriguing. And they had a lot of ideas for this episode where the presentation could have been more mysterious. But instead it feels slow, obvious and in the end, over-the-top vindictive and cruel. I know to not expect a fun or light topic for this series. But this one took some ideas which were potentially believable with improved technology and stretched them unnecessarily to where the antagonist became unbelievably cruel for the sake of exploring how evil some technology could become. Instead the goal should be creating an engrossing story related to the potential issues of technology. This one wallows in the issues too much. Nose dive was similar.And that is what is so upsetting. In both episodes the stories have some good ideas, great acting, great sets and great costumes, but the stories aren't written in a particularly strong way to get the most out of the ideas. The ideas and work come off like a missed opportunity."
3,12, Ignore All Negative Reviews! It's A POWERFUL CONTENT! And it will Show you Harmful effects of Upcoming Modern Technologies!,9.0,"I don't know why people rated this episode lowest among all those episodes available in season 3.In fact people Rated ""San Junipero"" episode for highest among all episodes in season 3.Ha Ha It seems like a Joke to me.This ""Men Against Fire"" Episode is such a brilliant episode which shows us how Neuro_Plantation could be a propaganda machine in near future generations! Especially for some Targeted Genocides. How people would be brainwash by this innovative technology. It also provided us some World War 1&2's original references, where most of the Soldiers refused to fire against each other and how shamelessly the generals tortured them to fire against Peoples; like that.This is such an Amazing plot and the Main Character Acted it brilliantly. The Screenplay, Musics, Action Sequences and horror factors all mixed up well together in this episode. So I can simply go with 9 Out Of 10 Stars for it. Coming into my Parental Guidance point- Just Avoid Watching it with anyone of your family member! It strictly contains pure frontal nudity and have some gored things as well.
You can go for this episode... Thumbs Up from my side."
3,12, Black Mirror standard,7.0,"I liked the military environment. Plus, unlike in other previous Season 3 episodes (except for Nosedive) the technology is crucial point of the story. Topic of propaganda and its spread via technology is, in today's ""post-factual"" times, highly relevant. The motive of eugenics is also up for discussion. Despite weaker last act it's stadnard BM episode."
3,12, One of the best episodes,9.0,"I had no idea what to expect from this episode. I was expecting people vs. zombies, but it was much more. The idea of seeing the enemy as ""the other"" makes it easy to kill. It is almost a reflection of what we are experiencing now. This person doesn't look like me, has a different religion, skin color, language or sexual or, therefore he is less human than me. We know, or should know, that is not the case. We are all humans. The story and lesson are thought provoking, and the acting by Malachi Kirby as Stripe was outstanding. After watching two disappointing episodes, Metalhead and Crocodile, Men Against Fire was a return to the classic episodes of Black Mirror."
3,12, Yay outter limits episode,2.0,"The first moments were okay, well female power characters and weak men... Ofc Netflix, would be actually better if main character was just preparing sandwiches but ok NVM :-) I don't mind replace stereotypes but let's just put them on the equal level else it is not making that much sense and is far away from reality.
After first action you will predict the plot, what was wierd that having soldier not explain what happened or reported how it went was at least strange. Main character is definitely the type who gonna get bitten by zombies doesn't tell anyone and get back to the base full of unaware people. I was also surprised that nobody asked him for the detail story what exactly happened. Stupid thing was that they had technology to saw through his eyes - hmmm surprise. Also he was really easily convinced what army did even if roaches could do the opposite and use their technology to made them look like ordinary ppl. Tbh like the original episode of the outter limits idea is great, could have been done better"
3,13, We Are Our Own Worst Enemy Sometimes,10.0,"This will be brief. The destiny of our world will probably be destruction because we are so out to lunch with our technology. Give access to the greatest possibilities for advancing civilization, we spend our time Tweeting and Texting and maligning. Right now we have a President whose life is devoted to attacking those who are weak and can't defend themselves. Cyber bullying is rampant. Since anonymity is a part of the game, hatred is parceled out by those who would normally be cowards. Are cowards. But this episode turns the tables. If the bad guys can get at the victims of cyber attacks, they can also get at the perpetrators of such things. The ugliness and mean spiritedness produces results unexpected. This held me spellbound and frustrated as those in power can't see their own rear ends (mistaking them for their elbows). Probably the best episode of this series."
3,13, Another Bleak and Scary Misuse of Social Media and Technology,8.0,"When the journalist Jo Powes writes a tough article criticizing the disabled activist that committed suicide, she becomes the most hated person in London. Soon she is found dead with sliced throat and her wounded husband becomes the prime suspect of Chief Inspector Karin Park that is investigating the case. However her new partner Blue Colson, who is expert in IT, suspects of a different reason. When the rapper Tusk mistreats live at television a young fan, he becomes the most hated person in the social media. Soon he has a seizure and dies at a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and the doctors find that a drone bee is the responsible. A further autopsy in Jo Powers shows the same cause and Blue finds that the hashtag #Death to seems to be the responsible for the deaths. Agent Shaun Li from a federal agency teams up with Karin and Blue and they head to the Granular Company that created the bees trying to solve the case. Will they succeed?""Hated in the Nation"" is another bleak and scary episode of ""Black Mirror"" showing a possible misuse of social media and technology by hackers and government. The result is impressive and shocking. The open conclusion does not give the sensation of satisfaction to the viewer that would certainly like to see Blue's revenge. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Hated in the Nation"""
3,13, Sensational drama.,10.0,"Black Mirror always manages to enthrall and entertain, and every so often it manages something verging on utter brilliance, Hated in the Nation is such an episode. It shows a craft, a skill, an intelligence, and proves that story telling is indeed an art. The imagination behind this is nothing short of genius, almost every element stuns.The fantastic story is equally matched by the superb performances, Kelly MacDonald and Elizabeth Berrington stand out for me, but everyone plays their part.I don't want to imagine a world without bees.Feature film feel and quality, this is one of the best. 10/10"
3,13," ""We're not in control anymore.""",10.0,"After watching three seasons worth of 'Black Mirror' it begins to dawn that the show might very well provide the impetus for some future crime. The science and technology posited in this story sounded credible enough for a would be terrorist like Garrett Scholes (Duncan Pow) to make good on a widespread panic fueled by average, every day citizens voting for their most reviled public figure. I really liked the way the episode was laid out with the seemingly unrelated deaths of celebrities who miscalculated their public statements. Former fans of the X-Files series will make note of the use of bees to facilitate human/alien hybrids, though in this case they were mechanical ones fashioned as autonomous drones. The twist in this story was superb, as the 'victim of the day' game played out not merely representing potential daily targets, but as a mechanism to draw thousands more into the deadly final solution envisioned by Scholes. The scores of bodies revealed near the end of the episode came nowhere close to the three hundred eighty seven thousand participants identified by Blue Colson (Faye Marsay), but that probably would have been overkill (pun intended). The final scene leaves just enough to the imagination to warrant a satisfactory conclusion."
3,13, Who's next?,8.0,"Killer bees, newspaper columnists, social media, rude rappers. Hated in the Nation has it all. I very much like the grey sky atmosphere of London portrayed in this episode, and the sunny countryside of the witness hideout. There's much to ponder in the manner that social media can round on errant folks in a disproportionate manner."
3,13, Weapons of Mass Destruction,9.0,"The four episodes of 'Black Mirror' I've so far seen have all seemed to be set in a near future in which people used advanced technology as casually as we use iPads. But of all of these this story most strongly resembles straight science fiction - and far surpasses most of the nonsense currently masquerading as sci-fi on both the big and little screens.The story intelligently combines elements that have already seen service in movies like 'The Spider Woman', 'The Birds', 'The Swarm' (naturally), 'Runaway' and 'Kamikaze', satisfactorily synthesised within a narrative that highlights the very current phenomenon of the growing and unwholesome power of social media. The special effects on a TV budget more than pass muster while serving rather than overwhelming the drama as it builds up to the powerful and unpredictable conclusion we have come to expect from an episode of 'Black Mirror'.Another winner from Charlie Brooker!"
3,13, 5,5.0,Again... It's wayyyy too long and boring. Couldn't watch full episode.
3,13," ""Let's just shut it down all social media the whole bloody internet. Pull the plug.""",6.0,"The whole series can be seen as an anthology of separate short films. ""Hated in the Nation"" is not even short, but has the duration of a classic feature film of an hour and a half. As much as, in most cases, the duration of the episode under an hour is too short a good idea to really develop, this time an hour and a half was too much.A classic SF thriller, whose premise might be realistic for the present, if we replaced the bee-drones from this film with something that fits into today's technology, and there are certainly some that would approximately serve the purpose. However, bees here are not only a tool for abuse, but also a warning of an ecological catastrophe that awaits us, because there are fewer and fewer bees, and they are absolutely necessary and irreplaceable for maintaining the ecosystem in which we live. And only from that side, I liked ""Hated in the Nation"".As for the psychology of the masses on social networks and their manipulation, this topic is becoming more and more boring, and ""Hated in the Nation"" did not approach it in a way fresh and original enough to attract my attention. The plot twist was obvious to me almost from the beginning, so there was no effect of a surprise either. I don't like the cast, although I have no major objections to how they carried out the story. All in all, a mediocre SF thriller, good enough to hold attention, but really nothing special and quite forgettable.6/10."
3,13, Thought provoking and a great concept but overlong and dull.,6.0,Black MirrorHated in the Nation (3 out of 5 stars).The plots a detective Karin (Kelly Macdonald) and her partner trying to solve a case of mysterious deaths. After the victim was already getting hated comments over the internet.This is by far the longest episode in the series. And it was the slowest and kind of boring. It has an interesting plot and the concept that takes place in the near future with technology without giving away spoilers. The theme of having a bad reputation over social media and how it can affect you in person with how people see you. Which can also be relatable.The direction feels different compared to other episodes. This definitely feels like one of those crime solving shows with the character being reviewed in court. And going over the events that lead to the court. The twist does leave you feeling unease. But the episode is slow moving.
3,13, Season Three,9.0,"This Third Season of Black Mirror brings forth the best batch of episodes yet (upped to six from the usual three of the first two seasons).Building off the spectacular ""White Christmas"" that closed out season two, Season Three delivers a slate of episodes in which only one (""Shut Up And Dance"") I considered subpar. All the rest are entertaining (at worst) or intensely thought-provoking (at best).Two episodes that really stand out:-""Nosedive"", in which Bryce Dallas Howard stars as a woman totally controlled by her social media feed.-""San Junipero"", which I can't describe much at all without succumbing to spoilers, but is my new favorite Black Mirror episode so far. I believe this episode won awards for its writing.I think the bottom line with this Third Season of Black Mirror is that it really ups the overall quality of the season from beginning to end. Whereas previous seasons really varied in quality, this one upped the floor (and even raised the ceiling with San Junipero).I'm more excited to continue the Black Mirror journey than at any other point so far in watching this show!"
3,13, The Bees! They're In My Eyes!,8.0,"It's not the bees' knees, but it's nice as synthetic honey."
3,13, Nicely done investigation with a touch of creepy Sci-Fi,8.0,"I welcomed the ""thriller"" format of this episode The police inspector played by Mcdonald has the sarcastic edge of somebody who's seen it all and does not want to get emotionally involved. The robotic bees were a nice touch, although the extinction scenario not so much..The idea here is that ""haters"" on social media should be punished, which would not be a bad thing. We probably all know what is like to receive offensive messages from anonymous strangers, sometimes just because of a casual remark on a social platform. This episode follows the concept of ""White Bear"", but it is way less creepy. Once again, the focus is on the people more than on the technology. Excellent way to end this series."
3,13, Not the bees,8.0,Hated In The Nation is pretty straightforward for a Black Mirror episode. Very entertaining even if I didn't like the last 3 minutes.
3,13, Best episode of season 3,8.0,"Working in the field I can appreciate the tech behind this and it was a great comment on the deleterious effects people can have en-masse on social media but unfortunately the end left me cold which loses it a point or two.They should have left it with the guy shaving his head and leaving but instead they had to stick in the obligatory USA style ending to roll things up instead of leaving the viewer to think!Apart from that it was well shot but the overuse of the ""f"" word is very tedious and quite unnecessary and really could do without it and the whole police, government and investigators were made to look like some pastiche of CSI Miami which was a bit laughable at times!It is quite prophetic episode if you just check this link - spooky eh!http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-41363465/bees-go-online-in- manchester"
3,13, Best episode of the series!,10.0,"After a couple of dubious episodes Nosedive and Playtest that started off Season 3, neither of which I liked due to the painfully annoying main characters, the series pumped out a couple of classics 'Shut Up and Dance' and the highly acclaimed and lauded 'San Junipero', then a good one 'Men Against Fire', and finally wrapping up with this one HATED IN THE NATION, which I think not only tops Season 3, but the entire series. A movie length episode clocking in at almost 90 minutes, HITN is an engrossing, edge-of-your-seat, informative police procedural with a witty script and top-notch acting.Anchored by brilliant performances by Kelly Macdonald (as Det. Karin Parke) and Faye Marsay (as Det. Blue Colson), HITN methodically reveals twists and turns without insulting the viewers' intelligence with red herrings. Parke is a veteran homicide detective and Colson is a rookie who just transferred from cyber crimes. The plot follows our 2 detectives investigating a string of murders related to advanced technology known as ADI, where mechanically engineered bees are being used to kill off unpopular citizens in via the twitter-verse. The genius of this episode is how it so effortlessly combines several current relevant topics and made it all seem like this scenario is possible in the near future. In addition to the 2 leads, the acting is really sublime throughout and not a single character annoyed me or stalled the storytelling. No joke, this exciting exercise would have been worthy of a big-screen presentation. It's that good."
3,13, NOT THE BEEEEEEEEEEES!,7.0,"Whilst I do respect their attempt, which is mostly successful, to expand upon the concept of the fatal consequences of online hate, I think they ended up stretching it to a fault. The narrative is compelling and complex, for the most part, as well as the moral aspect in itself, but the episode failed to be constantly engaging for me due to its relatively long runtime. Still, it's a great episode overall anchored by a brilliant cinematic cinematography and strong performances from everyone involved, particularly Kelly Macdonald.(7.5/10)"
3,13, Feature film noir,8.0,"This review contains spoilers.""Hated in the Nation"" is the sixth episode of the third season of Black Mirror. The episode is directed by James Hawes and written by Charlie Brooker. The episode is one of the longest Black Mirror episodes at 89 minutes of running time. The episode focuses on two police detectives in Karin Parke, played by Kelly Macdonald, and Blue Coulson, played by Faye Marsay. The detectives investigate murders that are seemingly caused by social media.""Hated in the Nation"" is a classic noir show. This episode follows the conventional tropes in a noir story but it is updated for the modern day. This episode felt more like a police procedural movie than an actual Black Mirror episode. I personally enjoyed this change as it made Black Mirror feel grounded. The slow investigation and build-up allowed for a more authentic story to be told. The two main leading characters played by Kelly Macdonald and Faye Marsay do an excellent job. They play the role of a veteran and rookie cop well.The main issue I have with the episode is the gaping plot hole. Once it was revealed that the ADI bees utilized facial recognition to find its targets, why could the characters not have utilized masks to assist the targets. This part of the story made no sense as the targets could have been saved.The episode is well shot and directed. For much of the episode, CGI is utilized to good effect. It made for an interesting spectacle seeing the autonomous bees in action as they honed in on their targets. The episode does not only rely on CGI to tell its story and most of it is kept light.I would recommend ""Hated in the Nation"". This is a solid Black Mirror episode.Grade: BBlack Mirror Season ThreeThe third season for Black Mirror is solid. This season has a great ensemble of episodes that reflect different themes and settings well. The first episode in this season is a solid look at social media and its impact on society. The series continues this theme of technology and society through the season. ""Man Against Fire"" had a nice commentary on the use of technology in the military. The season capped off with a near feature film in ""Hated in the Nation"". None of the episodes felt weak and the season is strong overall.I would recommend the third season of Black Mirror.Grade: B"
3,13, saw it coming,3.0,"figured it out within half an hour. as subtle as a hammer. something about the way it handles the subject of ""don't be a dick online"" seems so horribly inept and unclever, like a condescending anti-drug campaign that ends up making people want to take more drugs, just out of spite.given how hit and miss black mirror has been with these sort of moral message themes, they could have approached this idea of an ""outrage culture out of control"" much more convincingly and entertainingly instead of tying it in to a dull, badly-paced tech-y murder mystery complete with robot bees being hacked and made to swarm in a goofy CG sequence"
3,13, #hastag fly squatters at the ready.,8.0,"This one is A clever idea , by now the franchise is inter interlinking with other episodes/stories wont give away the spoilers but just keep your eyes peeled always and ears open.I could see the ending coming pretty much half way through this but I'm now watch for about 4th time...its black mirror after all.This might normally get higher than 8 from me but I'm rating as a franchise so I gave this one 8. I love the fact that although Netflix took over from Channel 4 it didn't all go across the pond.I hate wasps even more now.There as yet to be an episode I don't like and this is the only one so far that ends with...well I cant say otherwise it be a spoiler.As with nearly all BM you can watch any story in any order. This feature length ain't a bad start. Give it a go, theres better to come."
3,13," A short review of ""Black Mirror"" Season 3",10.0,"""Black Mirror"" (2011) remains the best science fiction show on television; I'd rate the six-episode third season a perfect 10. The show continues to succeed at every level with its story concepts and their execution. And I think it's actually getting better.It's getting darker and harder hitting, too. I'd guess that this season's blackmailing-hackers episode (""Shut Up and Dance"") would be the one that the majority of viewers find the most disturbing. For some reason, the man-vs.-monster story of ""Men Against Fire"" is the one that really got under my skin.I was surprised to learn that nearly all of ""Black Mirror's"" episodes are penned by series creator Charlie Brooker. I'm still surprised at how many clever ideas and lean, smart scripts could spring from one writer. I was so impressed that I looked Brooker up on Wikipedia -- but was surprised to discover I'm unfamiliar with nearly all of his other work. The one exception is ""Dead Set"" (2008) -- the truly fantastic British zombie horror miniseries that I've been recommending to friends for ages. That makes sense.Anyway, I am fully and happily converted to ""Black Mirror's"" cult following, and I enthusiastically recommend it to people who ask about it. (The show's popularity is still growing -- I believe it appeals to the same kind of fans as those who flocked to the various iterations of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" of generations past.) But I might actually suggest that newcomers begin with the second or third season, rather than the first. Season 1 is terrific, but it's three episodes are more subtle and thematic, while the latter seasons follow a more conventional story structure that might better appeal to more mainstream audiences. (They have more satisfying twists and emotional payoffs, too.)And a quick caveat -- I'll reiterate that this show is indeed dark. There is a strictly human element to most of ""Black Mirror's"" twists that is intended to surprise the viewer by provoking anxiety or dread. For a show that relies on technological story devices, it succeeds even more with its old fashioned psychological horror."
3,13," A dark, engrossing mystery ends a shaky season on a strong note.",8.0,"In my opinion, the third season of Black Mirror has been very shaky. Each episode has had its own major attributes and its own major flaws. This one is the least flawed of the season. And while it may not quite achieve the moral intensity of ""men against fire"" or the interpersonal chemistry of ""San Junipero"", these elements were strong enough to be serviceable, and much better balanced with each other. As a result, this is the most polished and watchable episode of the season.The plot focuses on the investigation of the mysterious death of a hated journalist. While this starts out as a commentary on the social media age, it gradually builds in more futuristic elements until it is full-on science fiction horror. I was pleasantly surprised by just how dark and terrifying it got by the end of the episode. This was the right episode to put at the end of the season, and it is probably the strongest overall."
3,13, Now that was a unique one.,10.0,"I think whatever was the bad parts of the episode but it never bored me at all. It was a fully thrilled detective sci-fi episode. I loved the bees.
What was interesting was the fact that just a hastag created all the problems and it was fair to say that if you wish someone to be dead, then you are a criminal mind too.
What struck me was the fact that why a website can't control just a hastag which is reason of many deaths."
3,13, The last AND the least: A brilliant episode which got killed by .... SPOILER ALERT!,4.0,"'Hated in the Nation' starts of like most Black Mirror stories: about a new technology that has gone bad, in this case, a social media app which is a thinly disguised Twitter. A Trollumnist made some truly horrendous remarks in her column about a vulnerable group (that is in reality also the Trollumnists formula: crap on the weakest members of society to invoke outrage and self-righteousness from the other side) and got huge crowds reacting very negatively to her. She's found dead later, and when an equally hated rapper (""rapper"" really gives it away: white middle class favorite Public Enemy no. 1) gets killed, it turns out they both got killed by Autonomous Drone Insects (ADI) or robot bees. These robot bees were manufactured by the millions to replace real bees who've gone extinct. Here is the first hole: the story focuses on Britain, and it doesn't, like it should have done, lampooned the reason why the UK couldn't import bees from the EU (oh wait ... Brexit?)Now it appears that someone hacked the access to control these bees and is sending them to kill anyone who is top of the list of unpopular people, determined by a hashtag #DeathTo. The whole process seems fully automated. The two female cops (one cyber expert, the other a veteran) who research this, find out who's behind all this and try, together with the company which invented the bees, (great example of why certain things should NOT be left to companies) to counterhack the hacker for control of the robot bees. They seem to have done that, and then the cyber saffy cop thinks they are walking into a trap laid by the hacker: the actual target is not the people on the list, but the people who have been VOTING to get people killed, or, 387,000 citizens. In typical government and Alpha male fashion, the government spook decides to not heed the female cyber cops warning and pushes the button (that should give them back control over the robot bees) anywayNeedless to say, the female cyber cop was right, it WAS a trap and 387,000 people die, killed by robot bees. Until this point and including the scenes of the hearing this episode is STILL good. But then apparently the writers just can't help themselves and attach some ""Crime Does Not Pay "" ending to it all. The Cyber cop has found the hacker and seem to be going to kill him in a Silence of the Lambs ""I'm having an old friend for dinner"" open-not-open ending. Which spoils everything! Because the lesson of Black Mirror has been consistently that technology leads to bad outcomes. And a revenge-good-girls-win-in-the-end kind of nauseating Happy Ending .... spoils all that. The message SHOULD have been: don't be mean on twitter just cos you're anonymous, it's gonna backfire ... badly. But now the message is: horrendous criminal gets whats coming to him, so all's well that ends well. I truly hope Charlie was forced into this by Netflix and not conceived the ending himself, because I would lose all respect for him as a writer. In their zeal to have not everything bleak (San Junipro, Be Right Back), the writers have truly Disneyfied this episode. What a pity, it's just 3 minutes too long.4/10 The Melancholic Alcholic."
4,14, A ridiculous premise...made enjoyable.,8.0,"The best thing about ""Black Mirror"" is the originality of the story ideas. ""USS Callister"" is certainly original! The only real problem is the premise, though very original, is utterly ridiculous. My advice is just suspend your disbelief and go with it!The show is about a very passive-aggressive man, Robert Daly. Although he's extremely shy and easily pushed around at work, he's developed an ultra-bizarre way of exacting revenge and feeling all-powerful. He's designed a huge multiplayer game but is apparently so brilliant that he's able to create exact copies of his hated co-workers and he torments them in this alternate reality. Here, Daly is the captain of a space ship (VERY MUCH like ""Star Trek"") and is these co-workers don't do EXACTLY what he wants, he tortures them. Eventually, a new co-worker is recreated in this world...and she's determined to defeat him even though he seems to hold all the cards.Just ignore the voices in your brain that say ""you can't do THAT"" and the like. Of course you can't...and it's a fantasy show. So sit back and enjoy...though the show is occasionally tough to watch because Daley is indeed a sadist."
4,14, How's That Again?,5.0,"Maybe I'm not smart enough to figure out what happened. Yes, I understand that an unhappy loser has found a way to enter his own video game and play god. What I don't think is sufficiently explained is the science behind it. I know he created characters from DNA samples and he cruelly uses them, but how is this supposed to work, even as speculative fiction? This series is drenched with cynicism about the future of the world. This episode seemed too comic."
4,14, A Big Joke with the Use of Technology and Star Trek,9.0,"The technician Nanette Cole arrives at the Callister Company to work with the lonely and shy nerd Robert Daly that she worships, who is the owner with his partner Walton. They are working in the update of the game Infinity created by Daly that must be released before Christmas. Soon Nanette learns that Daly is a patsy guy and the coworkers mock him. When Robert overhears her conversation with a colleague, he catches a cup of coffee in her garbage and brings home. Nanette awakes at an Enterprise-like spaceship called USS Callister and learns that her colleagues and she are crewmembers and Robert Daly is the fearless captain of the ship. Further, he controls their lives with infinity power and they shall obey him to avoid tragic consequences. What will Nanette and her friends do?""USS Callister"" is a big joke with the use of technology and Star Trek. The creative plot is well-written and well-resolved, with an optimistic conclusion for the USS Callister crew. It is also interesting to see the dark side of a human brain since Robert Daly has two opposite personalities that uses his knowledge to live a totally different life at home. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
4,14, A great start to Series 4,9.0,"When it started I could feel my high expectations fading, I thought I was in for a bad Star Trek spoof, but within minutes I realised that they'd come up with the goods in this episode. The plot is extraordinary, so incredibly imaginative, a wonderfully slick script and great performances all round. In the better episodes of Black Mirror you get absorbed in the crazy world, in this one I truly did buy into it. So imaginative, so good. 9/10"
4,14," ""Hold on, I think my pizza's here.""",8.0,"Wow, not a lot of love on this board for 'USS Callister'. I thought it was a blast right out of the box, knowing that the opening sequence was some sort of spoof that was going to be carried out through the rest of the story. As a fan of the original 'Star Trek' series, I enjoyed the characters and the similarities they shared with their Enterprise counterparts from the 1960's, especially actress Michaela Coel's resemblance to Nichelle Nichol's Uhura. The distracting thing though, was Robert Daly's (Jesse Plemons) resemblance to Matt Damon. That's who I kept thinking whenever he came on screen. The story itself you could poke holes through left and right. It doesn't make sense to me that a digital clone of someone would have that person's memories or share the same hang-ups their human counterparts would have. In service to the story though, this was an entertaining exercise that deviated from the often bleak, dystopian world that makes up much of 'Black Mirror'. The writers even managed to insert some sci-fi gobbledy-gook that I enjoy so much, such as when Captain Daly ordered the Callister into that asteroid gas cluster charged with ionized pyron particles, thereby increasing the ship's photon intensity. Too bad about the plasmorthian crystal though, they never did manage to get hold of it."
4,14," The Captain, the CEO, the programmer and Kirsten Dunst",8.0,"Kirsten Dunst has a blink-or-you'll-miss cameo in this provocative season 4 opener of Black Mirror. In real-life Kirsten is engaged to Jesse Plemons.Much has been written about USS Callister. It has over 47,000 iMDB votes, and almost 150 user reviews, which I think is the most part from Bandersnatch. I must confess I've never watched Star Trek, but I can still relate to the sly wink and a nod references to Gene Roddenberry's classic.I have a sense that the reviews for USS Callister fall into two broad camps. Those who see it as a parable of the me too movement. Then there are those who are drawn to the ""muscular"" captain and his humiliation of his ""subjects"" and political incorrectness and all that."
4,14, 9,9.0,"As the beginning of new season it was pretty well delivered. Plot was interesting,there was some cruelty but for me it wasn't enough ending was perfect really enjoyed watching it."
4,14," Cogito, ergo sum",6.0,"""USS Callister"", the episode that opens the fourth season of the ""Black Mirror"" series, came from a good idea for a premise, but the premise is poorly set and realized even worse.I like spoofs on the Star Trek franchise and its fanatics. I like the set design and the overall retro approach to the aesthetics of this episode. I also like the futuristic technology of virtual reality, although practically the same thing has already been seen in the episode ""San Junipero"".""USS Callister"" raises moral issues related to artificial intelligence and (mis)use of modern technologies, typically for ""Black Mirror"". It also brings us a study of the character of a macho bully, behind whose self-confident machoism and misogyny hides a difficult form of a lower value complex of a Trekkie nerd, a frightened and immature, but successful programmer and owner of a VR company.On the other hand, it is all very badly packaged in a story that had the potential for a serious and tense mindfak drama, and it turned out to be linear and unconvincing, like a children's picture book. Even the victory of good over evil in this story does not work well, because almost all the characters are more or less ""villains"", and our ""heroes"" are in fact villains overly punished for their ""crimes"" by a mentally ill person, who also does not deserves an end like this.Although promising at the start, the episode ""USS Callister"" has developed into a story full of completely incredible logical and technological holes and omissions, which we might be able to ignore for the sake of convincing characters with whom we can connect, cheer for them and fear for their destinies, or for the sake of strong moral. But when the ""heroes"" of the story are two-dimensional and just as repulsive as the ""villain"", and the moral message crap itself, then the only thing that can pull out a film is a powerful and well-written story, which this one certainly isn't.Technically well done, with an interesting aesthetics, but hollow in both the plot and the essence, this ""Black Mirror"" episode left me with a bland taste in my mouth.6/10."
4,14, Visually exciting and fun.,9.0,"Black MirrorU.S.S. Callister (4.5 out of 5 stars).The fourth season of Black Mirror opens up with an exciting, thought provoking, and fun episode. The concept pays homage to the old Star Trek series. Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) created a virtual reality gaming network. Were he lives through as a Captain of a USS Callister spaceship with his crew. Following on voyages and missions. Except, the crew members he has a copy of their consciousness from the real world people who are his coworkers in his company. Which in reality, he is treated poorly. But in the simulated world he can do whatever he wants. While acting up his favorite tv show called Space Fleet.The plot is thought provoking, and plenty of fun. The episode does get dark with the main character making you feel unease. And very much creepy. It does feel like a character study with a character being bullied at work. And how if he has the capabilities on doing whatever he can without rupercussions. Living in his own world.The twist at the end is thought provoking without giving away spoilers. The cinematography work and the camera angles does try mirror image how J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies are. The visual effects are not bad for a tv series. The costume and set designs plays like a 1080s sci fi series. It is one fun episode."
4,14, Great episode with only minor creepy elements,8.0,"Great start of the new season. A not too gloomy episode targeted on Sci-Fi from the 60's and the nerds who love it. By chance I just finished watching the second series of Fargo and I was pleasantly surprised to see two of the main characters in different roles.Piemons is Robert Daly, the lonely nerd managing a high-tech company by day and brave spaceship captain by night.Milioti, looking healthy and strong, is Nanette Cole, a contemporary woman who ends up trapped in the spaceship as an hapless, miniskirted girl from the 60s.Don't expect a Star Trek episode, even if at the start it looks a lot like that."
4,14, A really fun episode,8.0,"This one isn't really made to make you think and question your life. It's just an extremely entertaining, well made piece of television. It's very good."
4,14," Brilliant story, brilliantly told",10.0,"A novice games coder is trapped in the nightmare world of the genius she idolizes, and must use her smarts to liberate herself.Can't praise this enough. Lots of IMDb reviews have complained about plot holes, but they miss the point that without suspension of disbelief there is no drama: if a digitized clone is not sentient, it has no connection with the character we care about. Please ignore those reviews, because they were written by Robert H. Daly. If people want to see a plot hole let them look at the Last Jedi's treatment of an unsuited body in space, and compare that to the emotional description of the same given in this episode of BM.Apart from that, this is Brooker at the height of his power, with help from a wonderful co-writer: love of genre leading to satire of society, with a rich icing of terror and humour. Plus lovely plotting and pace.I would say lots more about the wonderful actors and set design etc, but IMDb has now made it practically impossible for me to access my review of the Twilight Zone episode from 1961 It's a Good Life, which I thought probably influenced Brooker's concept for Callister. Now I'll never know, and I can't see the point of reviewing on IMDb anymore. But had to do this last one, before the Mirror turns completely Black."
4,14," I know some Black Mirror fans don't like this episode, but I do (I love it).",10.0,"USS Callister is biting commentary on 'reboot-culture', gaming, internet trolls and nostalgia as a whole. This episode is almost like a loot-crate for sci-fi fans who grew up on this stuff (show runner Charlie Brooker did); you can see callbacks to things like the original Star Trek (obviously), the 2009 film reboot, Battlefield Earth, The Matrix, Toy Story, Interstellar, and even Guardians of the Galaxy (at least certain images did that for me). It evokes all these classics while telling a memorable tale in this anthology series masterpiece, showing how 'playing-master' over your subjects, even digital ones, is not necessarily a good thing.For me, this episode is probably the season-best alongside Black Museum and Hang the DJ. Black Mirror is innovative television at its best."
4,14, Immensely entertaining,10.0,"Even though Seasons 3 and 4 of Black Mirror have been rightfully accused of being more mainstream due to the Netflix streaming and requiring a wider appeal to continue going, mainstream isn't always a bad thing, and there's no further proof of that than this premiere episode of Season 4 called USS CALLISTER, an infectiously entertaining episode that pulls off the amazing feat of being both hilariously funny and darkly terrifying all within the same scene in several moments in the episode. With the obvious parody of the original Star Trek 60s series, there's also an homage to the classic Twilight Zone episode ""It's a Good Life"".CALLISTER tells the tale of Robert Daly (superbly played by Jesse Plemons), a computer genius and CTO of a tiny startup company specializing in virtual reality gaming. Daly is an extreme pushover and introvert, allowing everyone in his company to walk all over him, even though he's the 2nd-in-command. The CEO is Walton (excellently played in scene-stealing fashion by Jimmi Simpson), who implores Robert to be more authoritative to his employees. Daly seems like he's about to crack his introverted shell when a new hire coding phenom Nanette Cole (solidly played by Cristin Milioti), who worships Daly because of his tech expertise. Daly develops an immediate attachment to Nanette, but like everyone else, she eventually shuns him due to word of mouth around the company. So Daly in his own way takes action against his insensitive office cohorts.CALLISTER, while very funny, also has several moments of surprising power, especially as embodied in the performances of Plemons and Simpson. Although she plays a large role and her character was believable as quirky hacking geek in the real world scenes, I don't think Milioti really stood out in the Callister gaming scenes. Her humor felt a bit forced, although not enough to really take me out of the story due to the pace being relentless. The supporting cast (Michaela Cole, Billy Magnussen, Milanka Brooks, Osy Ikhile, and Paul G. Raymond) is also wonderful and nails their parts. A really strong way to start off Season 4."
4,14, Crikey,9.0,Who in the crap can think stuff up like this??? Man what a great episode and totally original concept. Kudos to the writers for having a crazy ass imagination!!! If you havent watched this episode definitely hit the play button!!! One of the better episodes no question about it
4,14, First one i watched and still 10/10,10.0,"I could write an essay or i could just write
Black Mirror Awesomeness, yep i will stick with that . Soild 10"
4,14, Nice one.,10.0,"Entertaining, enjoyable and thrilled with a proper sense of story. The best part was how cruel a man can be when this society rejects him.
And yes that technology was simply against the rights, I mean how can you trap someone maybe not a living one but still fully conscious and aware. Whatever but now they are free."
4,14," Good idea, flawed execution",7.0,"A Star Trek parody in Black Mirror is weirdly interesting. The story is fairly simple: genious nerd with no social skills tortures copies of real people in a VR game.The parody part works pretty well, but the show correctly doesn't dwell too much on it. It focuses instead on the ""trapped"" crew's efforts to escape. Which is where things go a bit wrong. First of all, the story has pretty big holes, unbecoming of Black Mirror's usual attention to detail. For example, Daly snaps his fingers and transforms others into monsters, has absolute control over the game, but...has to chase the ship. Secondly, it treats Daly as the bad guy, which isn't so strange, after all he is creepy, but pretty much ignores that the others are even worse (except for Nanette, who serves as the vehicle to 'prove' Daly is bad). It's not a question of who wins (the ending is also very un-black mirror like in terms of convenience), but of...I don't know, poor prioritisation maybe."
4,14, Too much unnecessary swearing and bad language,5.0,"The episode itself was okay. I liked the story idea. However, there was a lot of bad language in spots that I felt were just unnecessary."
4,14, The mirror universe of Galaxy Quest,10.0,"With overtones of 'I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream' by Harlan Ellison this was a superbly written - produced and acted episode.Whereas in Ellison's apocalyptic masterpiece a computer called the shots - here it was a human although it was hard to tell the difference.So what happens when you're a bit of a bullied geek in the real World? Well you create your own Universe where you're in total command and have God like powers to bully digital versions of chosen employees from your company.Perhaps we've all imagined ourselves in an alternative World - free to do as we please - well almost for in this World the poor captives had been given the same tools as Action Man to procreate - a good example of how to make things that can't proceed smoothly.Could it ever happen? Well media giants are collecting more and more data about us - and already you can leave a digital version of yourself - but can a digital version achieve consciousness? Well we'd certainly would be going to where no one has gone before - and with a limitless digital galaxy to explore I'm sure our digital selves would have a whole lot of fun."
4,14, Where is Callister TV spin off,10.0,"I don't remember something like that happening in television before... Black Mirror came up with such brilliant, dark , amazing and funny concept that this episode alone could be turned into an entire TV show... The target audience of this show are Trekkies, gamers and mmorpg players... Yes EVE online / Elite Dangerous / Star Citizen I am looking directly at you... If you know any of the titles above I am surprised you are reading this and did not start watching yet..."
4,15, Helicopter parenting gone amok....,8.0,"What I enjoy about ""Black Mirror"" is that many of the episodes look at modern technology and anticipate their potential abuses and down-sides. In this case, the notion of being a helicopter parent is taken to an amazing level...thanks to tracking software and iPad-like devices. The story begins with a baby being born and all seems well. But when the little girl later walks off and the mom is panicked, she picks an unusual way to protect her child...she has a chip installed in her called 'Arkangel' and it tracks her. But the chip can do much more. It can actually filter out negative images and content...and the mother decides to use this as well. So, instead of seeing blood and violence and bad behavior, the child just sees pixilated images and cannot hear the awfulness. Sounds like a great idea, huh? Well...as the child grows, it's like having NSA inside her head...and the repercussions are awful.The most interesting thing about this story is that it was directed by Jodie Foster (yes, THAT Jodie Foster). This, along with some impressive location shoots in ensuing episodes shows that this show has found an audience! As for this particular episode, while it's not among the best, it is quite disturbing and well made....and well worth your time."
4,15, The Die is Cast!,6.0,"Once the overprotective mother has an implant installed, she has set things in motion that can only get worse. Sara, in an opening scene, chases after a cat and her mother becomes obsessed with protecting her. She has kind of iPad that can be used to check her heart rhythms, her nutrition, and most of all, what she sees. The kicker is a device that blocks anything that may be traumatic, so the girl grows to adolescence having a totally sheltered life. When the plug is pulled, she begins to experiment like crazy with her peers. Soon the mother resurrects the device with horrible consequences. The episode is really hard to watch. The mother is really the central character in that she can never accept her daughter being on her own."
4,15, Lack of Privacy,8.0,"Marie is an overprotective mother of Sara since she was born. When Sara is a little girl, Marie loses her in a playground and decides to experiment a new technology to control what Sara can see or not and track her, implanting a chip in her. When Sara is a teenager, Marie promises to remove the parental controls from the device and put it aside. One night, Sara stays until late hours making love with her boyfriend Trick in his van by the lake and Marie restarts the device, seeing what her daughter is doing. What will Sara do when she discovers what her mother did?""Arkangel"" is an episode of ""Black Mirror"" that makes any father or mother think of how far he or she shall control his or her kids using technology and keeping their privacy. There are smartest ways to do that not necessarily using a parental control of an electronic device, but with dialogue. The conclusion is absolutely predictable, despite of Marie best intentions. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Arkangel"""
4,15, Parental guidance gone mad.,9.0,"I'll admit to being initially underwhelmed by this one, but as it went on it got better and better, with the story becoming more and more compelling and the agenda of Sara's overbearing mum Maria becoming more controlling. With all the enhancements in technology and society's craving for more and more technical integration the real scare here is this felt like something that could perhaps be a reality one day. The arguments for and against the implant device are well balanced, you see things from viewpoints of Sara and Maria. Superb performances from Rosemarie DeWitt and Brenna Harding, and wonderfully directed, bravo Jodie Foster. Another sizzling episode. 9/10"
4,15," ""Just throw it away. Problem solved.""",7.0,"Perhaps the reason this episode of 'Black Mirror' fails for a lot of viewers is because it's possibly the one that comes closest to examining a technology that could actually exist today. Let's face it, the ubiquitous cell phone with it's ability to take pictures and record what's happening in real time has changed the lives of everyone using it, some for better and some for worse. In the case of 'Arkangel', an implant of some sort provides a masking ability as well, so that unpleasant or troubling images can be blurred to the recipient of the implant. It wasn't really made clear in the story why the Arkangel project was banned, but one suspects it would be for it's invasive impact on the subjects being supervised. A very creepy affair when a someone can dial into a sexual encounter or view illegal drug use about to occur. And as always, unintended consequences can often intrude to derail one's life without any apparent warning. For once, this is a Black Mirror episode that could actually take place."
4,15, Have you checked the children?,7.0,"Arkangel is directed by Jodie Foster, and all credit to the location manager for giving Hamilton, Ontario, a special spot in the annals of Black Mirror. Here this episode presents helicopter parenting to the extreme (parents with prams screaming ""EXCUSE ME!!!!!""). It's not a pretty sight, with the mother, Marie Sambrell (Rosemarie DeWitt) realizing she can see everything her daughter Sara (the wild teenage version played by Australian actress Brenna Harding).The ending is sad but inevitable.How far should parents let go of their kids?"
4,15, 8,8.0,Very decent episode showing that you can't save your childs from whole dangers in life.
4,15," I expected much more from Jodie Foster and Charlie Brooker than the unimpressive ""homage"" to King's ""Carrie""",6.0,"A single mother is overly protective of her daughter. After the girl is briefly lost in a local park, the mother includes them in an experimental program, where a chip is implanted in the child's head. It sends the child's current location and vital functions to the parent 24/7, as well as live transmission of everything the child sees and hears, with the additional option of scrambling everything that could be stressful for the child.From the start, it is clear that this approach to parenting can not only go wrong, but inevitably have to go wrong, which makes this ""Black Mirror"" episode a story about bad, even disturbed parenting, more than the (mis)use of futuristic technology.A child who is unable to see and hear anything ugly, scary, violent, sexual, vulgar, is a child who cannot grow up and become able to face the everyday reality in which she lives. And when this practice continues into adolescence, counterproductiveness grows into a disaster.The premise could have evolved in multiple directions, with much potential for a powerful episode. Unfortunately, they developed it into a predictable melodrama, with a boring slow-paced story and a twist that is both predictable and so over-the-top to the point of nullifying even the little credibility that the episode had.Instead of a futuristic mindfuck drama or thriller with a strong message that makes you think, we got a lukewarm teenage melodrama, with an ending that seems to have escaped from some B horror of the eighties and a chewed-up lesson. The whole episode leaves an outdated impression, and that does not fit in with ""Black Mirror"".6/10."
4,15, Interesting concept but boring story.,6.0,"Black Mirror
Arkangel (3 out of 5 stars).The episode follows a mother Marie (Rosemarie DeWitt) who gets very overprotective over her daughter Sara (Brenna Harding). Ever since, she was almost lost at a park when she was little. She invested in a new technology that is implanted inside the daughter's head. Which she can monitor, tracks the gps, check on her health for any hormone balances, and see what she sees.The episode does play a few interesting concepts with the Arkangel technology. Which has its benefits and downside. Which also one can relate to how society is now. Some parents were taught that kids need to have a little of freedom so they can learn to grow, and experience things and learn from it. Now, some may want to protect their children from any stressful situations. Which the device in the show can filter any stressful moments by blurring out the other persons face, or any violent situation. Or even blood. When Sara is a teenager. And goes out with her boyfriend. Which they have a sexual encounter. While the mother is paranoid and snoops on her tablet to see what she is seeing. Or notices she has been experiencing cocaine.I did feel like this episode was a little weaker than most in the series. It was a bit dull and boring. The concept seemed a little done before with The History of You episode. Were one can snoop into another persons memories. There was nothing mind bending or twists to make this episode stand out. It has an interesting concept that was done before and a plot that is a little bit decent."
4,15, Possibly the worst so far,1.0,"After the brilliant start, this second episode is a major downer. Possibly the worst of the whole series. A scary DeWitt, with an ugly haircut, plays Marie, a woman in her late 40s who becomes the single mother of baby Sara.IVF is my guess, because Marie does not look like the type of woman who welcomes male attention. I read somewhere Marie described as a 'young"" single mother. DeWitt is 46 and looks like it. Nothing wrong with that, but ""young mother"" is not.Anyway, Marie one day almost loses her precious child in a playground and decides to have a chip implanted in Sara's head so that she can check Sara's location and see what Sara sees, via a tablet.Lots of reviewers claimed that it was ""too easy"" to foresee where the plot was heading. That's a lazy way to follow a story, just trying to guess what the plot twist could be. For me is the whole narrative that matters, with or without plot twist.What I disliked in this episode is not the predictability. It is easy to guess trouble ahead with a teenage daughter and an over-protective mother without a life of her own. I disliked: Sara's excessive bad behaviour, Marie hypocrisy and cowardice of not confronting her daughter, and the over-melodramatic ending. Not to mention the creepiness of Marie spying on her child's sexual activity and interfering with her life, without saying a single word about what is going on.In short, I disliked the whole narrative and not its predictability. I saw at the end that Jodie Foster directed and I was definitely underwhelmed.PS and yes, the actress playing teenage Sara looked older than 15 - the whole episode had a problem with age."
4,15, worth a laugh,5.0,"I could easily see within the first several minutes what this episode was going for. After 4 seasons it's easy enough, as Black Mirror has the subtlety of a Trump speech at the best of times.
However, it still managed to execute a somewhat entertaining story about the perils of overprotective parents and wanting to keep a perpetual watch on their children, this time via a spying technology that gets implanted into a woman's daughter at a young age. It lets her monitor all her vital signs, as well as maintain a constant GPS monitor of her location, and even be able to see through her eyes what ever she sees.
Right away it starts going wrong as the mother uses/abuses the Parental Control filter, resulting in ""violent"" imagery the daughter sees to be laughably ""pixelated"" in real time, up to and including curse words and barking dogs. Thankfully, the mother removes this filter before her daughter can become a sociopathic mass murderer, after an incident where she intentionally cuts herself to see her blood become pixelated then smear it on her face.
As the girl grows up, it becomes a more straightforward drama of the perils of raising a teenage daughter when you're a psychotic control freak. I get the theme they were going for, but the actions of the mother, including threatening her daughter's boyfriend with either a statutory rape or child pornography charge, along with potentially poisoning her daughter by secretly feeding her an Emergency Contraception pill to terminate her potential pregnancy, makes it utterly impossible for me to sympathize with the mother in any way.I already knew from the very start that the ""Arkangel"" program thing was a monumentally bad idea, but didn't dismiss the episode because I know this exact sort of program would see widespread use in the real world with plenty of parents ranging from slightly concerned to paranoid and potentially abusive.the way it played out was a bit formulaic and completely predictable, but ultimately it was worth a bit of mild interest.The only major problems it had, which caused me to rate it so, was that several events which were meant to be dramatic played out in a clumsy way that made it laughable. And while I'm not a parent and so I can't fully understand the mother's mindset, I cannot imagine any (sane and normal loving) parent thinking it's a good idea to do things like secretly slip a birth control (or apparently a super-powerful morning after) pill into your daughter's drink after brute forcing your way into destroying her romantic relationship"
4,15, No more playing out till dark,9.0,I liked this one because of the amount of eventual possibilities that are available now and will be at some time. This goes way beyond checking your kiddies phone location etc but how many mums or moms out there would actually participate in the Arkangel if available today. I'm guessing millions and for me you can't watch this with a level head and realise that once again it's a BM protest to stay STOP! ENOUGH! we are abandoning all forms of human existence as it once was.A very sad using the phrase in many ways episode but another important part of the franchise.
4,15, Could be a TV show on its own,8.0,"Spoiler warning!As a teen this episode really hit me close, I can't imagine what it would feel like if my parents had also gotten a 'Arkangel' for me as a child. Well this episode answered my question. It is a good episode and would be a good concept for a TV show but I do have my complaints. The casting mostly, her daughter looks like she is going through her fourth divorce and the pace could have been a bit faster! I also found it a bit ridicilous that the mom really put abortion pills to her drink, yeah it was supposed to show her paranoia but, really? Overall a good episode. Worth the watch."
4,15, Growth of an individual should be in a Natural way! Overprotection is like making individual's path hard for future problems!,7.0,"Hmm! This episode is really brilliant and definitely recommendable to all the parents. It's gives us lessons and I also support over-protection or Over-Parenting is not that effective for a small child to be self-empowerment especially during his/her growth period. Child can go in a wrong path, but that's our duty to teach them properly what's right and what's wrong in this world and it's consequences. And for God sake plz Teach every small kid about Spirituality. Tell them it's importance and Be a Good mentor for Yoga and Satsang for them as early as possible.Overall a Good episode indeed. It will directly affect into your brain and for sometimes you'll have to thing what's right and what's wrong in this storyline. Because you have to consider Both (Mom and Child's) Point of views and intentions.
Anyway 7 Out of 10 Stars from my side.
It have some violence and mild reference to sexual activities, So better to avoid watching it with family."
4,15, Predictable helicopter-parenting story,7.0,"The topic is civil, if somewhat predictable and boring. There's really nothing interesting or beyond average in this episode. It's not bad, just average. However, in terms of real-life it's very disturbing because the things displayed in the episode (overprotection, developmental issues as a result of overusing digital technolgoies) are already happening today."
4,15, Love of a Mother,9.0,"We all know that no one will love us more than our mothers, literally there is no one who will be able to love us and protect us like our mothers.But what will happen if the mother is over protective, can modern-technology destroy the pure unconditional love between a child and his mother."
4,15," Not the best, not the worst",7.0,"Why cast someone who's clearly 20+, as a 15-year-old? I couldn't suspend my disbelief on that one.Other than that, decent episode that, while failing to stick the landing, should provide an adequate cautionary tale."
4,15, Wrong On So Many Levels,1.0,"1- This episode was mainly about ""danger of having a super protective mother"", not the danger of a parental control device.
2- Why would anyone have the need for inventing such a device? Children have to FACE the life's beauty and ugliness, ups and downs, cleanliness and dirtiness by THEMSELVES, everybody that is a parent should know it already that restricting a child from facing life's hardship is equal to delaying the child's maturity which makes them vulnerable to life's dangers, it's not a rocket science.
3- The device was actually useful and it helped the mother know her daughter was doing drugs and sex. 
4- If it's so well-known that underage children like 12 year old elementary school children are watching porn (alone or together) as if it's a normal behavior, it should be a warning sign to society and people must know that Internet porn is very easily accessible by their children and as a probable outcome they'll do what the 15 year old girl/boy did in the movie. I kinda felt bad for today's society and its permissive attitude towards its ugly normals."
4,15," Very watchable, but it could've been so much more.",6.0,The initial premise of this episode had me filled with great anticipation for another thought provoking gem. However as the story rolled on it became as predictable as spinning a 50 pence piece on a table. It never quite got to the edge and inevitability spun to a flat and foreseen ending.
4,15, Donna from that 70s show with,1.0,"BORING episode....., that dog didnt even barked at her when she was passing by........, it was clear someone was instructing the dog when to bark ....in this future everyone is a hipster wearing THICK granny sweaters"
4,16, In the future....a small crime can easily escalate into atrocities!,7.0,"This episode, oddly, is set in Iceland and although I appreciate this change, it is odd as just about everyone has an Irish or British accent! I've been to Iceland and loved it...and cannot recall a single local who talked that way!The show begins with a drunk driver accidentally running over a biker and killing him. Instead of doing the right thing, he convinces his female passenger to help him dispose of the body.Years pass. The drunk driver has stopped drinking and is wracked with guilt over the other man's death. To try to make some amends, he wants to tell the man's wife that he is dead so she can go on with her life. He plans on sending an anonymous letter to the woman....but makes the mistake of letting his accomplice know his intentions. VERY bad things ensue...much worse than I could have anticipated. And, oddly, they get much worse due to the use of equipment that can record your thoughts and actions. How does this device and an insurance investigation lead to even more bloodshed? See the show.
Once again, ""Black Mirror"" looks at technology and tries to predict how it can run amok...and run it certainly does!! Overall, a very interesting episode which you should see IF you have a high threshold for violence. See the show...see what I mean."
4,16, Sick Stuff!,6.0,"Mia is the principal character. When her boyfriend hits a bicyclist while driving drunk, she reluctantly helps him dispose of the bike and the body. When he shows up years later, filled with guilt, she kills him and disposes of his body. But there is a technology being employed by insurance companies that allows witnesses to recall things they may have overlooked. When Mia is approached, she realizes that she is going to be caught for the murder and takes dramatic steps to cover things up. Not just dramatic but psychotic. This series has a lot of sick stuff in it and this one sort of takes the cake. One question. Are Guinea pigs reliable witnesses?"
4,16, The Cold-Blooded Woman,8.0,"After leaving a night-club, Rob is driving through a lonely road with his girlfriend Mia when he hits a cyclist. Mia wants to call the police but they are drunken and Rob convinces Mia to help him to throw the body and the bicycle in a lake. Fifteen years later, Mia is a prominent architect, family woman married with a nine-year boy. When she goes to a city for a lecture, she stays in a hotel. She receives Rob, who tells that he has stopped drinking and wants to write a letter to confess to the cyclist´s widow what they did. Mia unsuccessfully tries to dissuade Rob to give up the idea. He persists with his intention and she kills him and plots a plan to get rid of the body. Meanwhile the efficient insurance investigator Shazia Akhand is investigating an accident in front of Mia´s hotel using a ""recaller"", a state-of-art device capable to scan and record the memories of witnesses of an accident. Their lives will be entwined through the memories of a witness with tragic consequences. ""Crocodile"" is an intriguing episode of ""Black Mirror', with a cold-blooded woman capable to commit a crime spree to keep her family and life style. Therefore, Mia is the crocodile of the title. The recaller is a scary device capable not only to solve cases but also a danger if on the hands of the wrong persons. The conclusion, with the police technicians using the device in a guinea pig, is ironic. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Crocodile"""
4,16, What a powerful sixty minutes of drama.,10.0,"The first two from series four have been very good, quality episodes, but this one puts Black Mirror firmly back at the top of the drama genre, this particular episode is unlike anything else I've ever seen. The story is mind blowing, and the delivery is sublime. Massive plaudits for every cast member, in particular Andrea Risborough, she is nothing else but spellbinding, an incredible performance from her. The ending was almost unwatchable, tragic and harrowing, delivered in a way that ties all parts of the plot together, all the minor incidents fit together nicely. Incredible, 10/10"
4,16," ""We coulda been anything that we wanted to be...""",7.0,"One must accept a lot on faith if this episode is to have any meaningful impact on you. My first 'what the heck' moment came when Mia (Andrea Riseborough) choked out and killed Rob (Andrew Gower) when he came by to state his intention to confess to the accidental death of the biker. His proposition seemed logical enough and he was going to keep his name anonymous. How Mia could have overpowered him didn't seem credible to me at all.I had some trouble with the recall machine as well. When the old dentist believed the slicker he saw the woman wearing was lime colored, shouldn't that have been the color in the image he remembered? When Shazia (Kiran Sonia Sawar) stated to Mia at the start of her 'recall' interview that 'private stuff is private stuff', it sounded like a tip-off that she already knew about the porn movie Mia rented. She did of course, but that was an unforced error that put Mia even more on the defensive for what she could potentially reveal. But the kicker of course was old Codger the guinea pig. Really? He was going to provide Mia's identity via the recall machine? That was an interesting twist that would have made more sense in an old time series like 'The Twilight Zone', but in one in which modern technology provides the linchpin to the effectiveness of these Black Mirror stories, it takes a tremendous leap of faith to believe an animal with a tiny brain like a guinea pig could be a credible murder witness. As for the title of the story - Crocodile?"
4,16, Crocs on ice,8.0,"Iceland is beautifully presented in this blood-gore fest. I can't recall if any other episode of Black Mirror has more murders than this one. It gets especially gruesome at the end that's for sure, especially with the baby. Who would have thought?"
4,16, 8,8.0,That was really good episode I liked the main idea that the truth always comes out it doesn't matter how long you're going to hide it.
4,16, Mercylessly over the edge,8.0,"An insurance agent is investigating a minor car accident, using a device that reads the witness's memory. But one of the witnesses inadvertently reveals to her a dark secret from the past, which she must now cover up at all costs.I have a lot to say about this ""Black Mirror"" episode, but a deeper analysis requires specific details that would spoil the story, and for a full experience, it is best to enter this adventure with as little prior knowledge as possible. For the most part, it is predictable enough that the additional information I would present here would completely ruin it.Many resent its unconvincingness, in the sense that it is not in human nature to choose the path that the protagonist took, and that on that path she could not physically perform everything she does in the episode, and on top of all that she does it so nonchalantly and still no one caught her in the act.True, the story has holes and illogicalities, but it is not so naive, because this is not about the average person, but about someone driven into psychopathy by fifteen years of guilty conscience combined with the urge to protect the family. The drama of a mentally unstable mother, who struggles with a guilty conscience and tries to keep the family together, sinking deeper into madness and eventually turning into a monster, is shown strong and impressively enough to distract you from the holes and illogicalities.Many also blame it for not being in the spirit of the ""Black Mirror"" series. And I agree with this too. While ""Black Mirror"" deals with the positive and negative impacts of technology on the individual and humanity as a whole, basing plots on specific examples of (mis)use of technological advances, this episode is based on the characterization of the protagonist, while the Sci-Fi element is there just to push the story in the desired direction and provide the final plot twist.If not a particularly representative episode for ""Black Mirror"", viewed outside the context of the series, ""Crocodile"" is a great psychological drama-thriller. With a well-balanced pace and duration, a great choice of scenography, a tense atmosphere, and a story that gradually transforms from a drama into a thriller and pushes further to the edge of horror, it held my undivided attention until the final twist, which serves as both a shocker and a comic relief.All this, along with the fact that the protagonist is so skillfully brought close to the audience that I sympathized with her all the way, and even at times cheered for the monster to get away with her crimes, is reason enough for me to disregard all the clichés, holes and illogicalities in the story.8,5/10."
4,16, Redundant story but interesting concept.,7.0,"Black MirrorCrocodile (3.5 out of 5 stars).This episode story plays out more like a how to get away with murder type of concept. Mia (Andrea Riseborough) and Rob (Andrew Gower) are driving home. And they accidently hit a biker and killing him. Afraid of the consequences, they toss the body and his bike into the lake. Years later, Mia is married and successful in her career. When Mia witnesses a guy getting hit by a self driving vehicle. And an insurance investigator Shazia (Kiran Sonia Sawar) is looking for witnesses. And using a memory device technology which she can see the memories and their perspective.It was an interesting plot. But the story did not deliver anything spectacular. The concept that a memory device can solve any murder by going through the witnesses memories to see the exact evidence. Its pretty neat and creepy. The episode did deliver some suspense and thrills. The direction does get very dark in nature. On how far a person would go to keep their names cleared and safe. The direction, cinematography, and the set location taking place in Iceland. Did deliver some fantastic and beautiful shots. It kept the tone feeling like you are isolated and the beautiful eerie scenery of Iceland.Overall, the episode does not deliver anything sharp with its story. The concept is interesting. And there is a twist which is not as a surprise or mind blowing like previous episodes. Definitely worth checking out."
4,16, Great location for a disturbing episode,7.0,"The best thing about ""Crocodile"" is the beautiful, yet desolate location. Set in Iceland, it's a story of cowardice, selfishness and violence that will ultimately undo the perfect life of main female character Mia.After having accidentally killed a cyclist on the road and disposed of the body, Mia and her boyfriend split. 15 years later Mia is a successful businesswoman, while the ex-boyfriend is a looser, whose only achievement is to be a reformed alcoholic. Enters one of the most annoying and overused plot devices in thriller movies: the boyfriend visits Mia in town for a conference and tells her he's going to confess to the heartbroken cyclist's wife, albeit via anonymous letter.This type of revelation is used often in movies to set in motion violent actions that could be avoid had the ""talkative"" character kept the mouth shut. By now, people with guilty secrets should know better than to inform their partners in crime about their dangerous decisions. Yet, the ""fatal"" revelation pops up over and over again.Apart from this contrived plot device, Mia downfall is caused by a device that can read memories, even if we're warned that memories are subjective and unreliable. Mia's motivation behind killing people is that she has to protect her ""family"", which is another disturbing sign of people vs. society.Finally, Mia's decision are not only criminal but also stupid. It would have been a lot easier to get away with a slap on the wrist for an accident (although keeping silent for 15 years not so good) than trying to justify a sequel of murders.PS Andrea Riseborough is really good as Mia. I hardly recognised her from her role in Oblivion."
4,16, fun but predictable,8.0,"Fun but predictable. my only problem with the story is that it only works as a facet of its theme (technology bad) which actually isn't a flaw in itself, it's the whole point of the series as a whole.Basically, the events as they unfold would not have been able to happen if not for the technology in use by the Insurance claims woman that allows her to basically view people's memories. Otherwise, it was pretty straightforward and compelling. Interesting enough to stand on its own, but not particularly memorable beyond the technological aspect."
4,16, Where there's blame! Theres a serial killer as a witness,8.0,"I guess it's a reference to crocodile tearsa little bit overkill ( to coin a phase ) maybe , a little bit unrealistic how she gets to be in the situation where she finds herself in particular all that driving.But the ending is rarther funny that it ends up being a ........ ........ that is wired up .
Not the best in the bunch but i love the continuity in Black Mirror and this episode marries up with 15 million very well ."
4,16, Running on empty,4.0,"How is this tiny woman supposed to have killed any of these people by hand? The last man she kills doesn't even put up a fight. If you think someone would go down so easily, check out Federal Express Flight 705.If you know you've done some murders, maybe you should talk to a lawyer before willingly agreeing to be connected to the insurance lady's mind reader gizmo?And would a lone insurance person really go out to people's remote houses to read their minds? I would wager there are a whole host of reasons in this obviously non paradise Iceland that people wouldn't want their dirty laundry hung out.It's indeed shot in Iceland. Well, great, so what? It's very nice to look at, but any look can now be easily created in a basement in Witchita. To me, all that suggests is that got a tax break to film there. How about instead, they cast a lead that could remotely plausibly do these crimes?I can handle suspension of disbelief, but there are limits. Maybe the guinea pig could have done all these crimes, right, why not?And it's not like this episode features some mind blowing concept that makes one look past all the flaws, it's a mild reshuffling of well worn concepts from this show. What could have made this far more interesting perhaps would have been a some sort of analysis of the legal and moral issues of the brain reader.The acting itself was solid, so no knock on the actors."
4,16," Well, now you've done it, Black Mirror...",3.0,"I can say this much: this episode finally got me rooting for a serial killer to get away with her murders. Sure, she turned out to be a nasty piece of work, but I couldn't stop feeling sorry for the poor woman who got repeatedly hit on the head with a stupid stick by the writers. I've already come to the conclusion that the cops appearing at the end were just strippers in cop costumes there to celebrate a successful opening night for a middle school play and our heroine went on to lead a long and happy life without ever getting caught.Seriously -- the way the writers beat her mercilessly with a stupid stick was far more abhorrent than any crime she allegedly committed (at this point, I actually believe her innocence.)"
4,16, Darkest Black Mirror Episode! With a Thought Provoking Message!,7.0,"Certainly I have witnessed a Darkest and Creepiest Black Mirror episode ""Crocodile"".It have a good message to all peoples that If you've committed a Crime then accept it as fast as you can! Otherwise it will lead you to more bigger crimes which couldn't be forgivable.
And also this episode gives us hints about Our Privacy of Memory is also not safe! I mean anyone can crack our memories as well and Our Privacy is Like a Joke with this Hi-Tech Memory Recaller Technology.This Episode is not for Light hearted peoples! Because They need guts to watch some horrible crimes inside this episode very violently.
Overall a Good episode for me and I like to go for 7 Out of 10 Stars for it. Avoid watching it with Family ."
4,16, Very dark & not really BM,6.0,"Probably the darkest BM episode ever. The technology (memory reading, similar to The Entire History of You) is completely unimportant (but the question of use of such surveillence is pretty important), instead the episode focuses on murder and its psychological consequences. Crocodile would be pretty weak, but at least the cold nordic atmosphere, dark soundtrack and breathtaking Iceland aesthetic partially make up for the rest of the episode."
4,16, Our own memory can be dangerous,8.0,"Modern Technology once more, what is right and what is wrong.Who get to watch your memory, who get to watch your daily life routine.We can not ignore the benefits of modern-tech on the other hand, we can not live with it."
4,16, The hampster did it!,4.0,"Seriously...what was the point? It was just basically a cover-up horror flick with a little piece of technology thrown in. And we're supposed to believe that this tech that relies on people being coached (to the point of sniffing beer) can be used on hampsters? What, did they wave some corn in front of its nose? I guess the point is that someone is always watching...even if its a gd hampster. Now we just need to get the mice from Iranian nuclear sites and interview them and see if they are making WMDs."
4,16," Yes, the worst episode of the series so far",3.0,"Much of the episode is unbelievable. I don't mean the technology, I mean the behavior. It is impossible to believe that the protagonist would go from being a sensitive young woman to a cold blooded serial killer, even murdering a baby. Also, how did she strangle a guy who had to be much stronger than she? I get that she wanted to preserve her family and career, but that was not the way to do it. A confession to the original accident would have been better. I never felt any sympathy for her, but I certainly did for her victims. The ending, or, more appropriately, the non ending was a disappointment as well. Was not killing the guinea pig actually her downfall or did she get away with four murders?
All in all, it was a very implausible story.
On the other hand, the scenes of Iceland were awesome."
4,16, Disaster,1.0,"This episode left me with too many hows, whys and whats. Why is there nobody on the road except those two friends? Why don't they think that there might be somebody coming on the road so they have to hurry? Why not bringing the car closer to the body and moving it to somewhere else instead of dragging it on the open field? How can the girl easily kill his bigger ex-boyfriend so cold-bloodedly as if it isn't her first murder? Why is Shazia allowed to use that low enforcement related high-tech without any police around protecting her? Why is that all the futuristic devices in BM are applied to or have something to do with the sides of one's forehead? How is that the screen of that apparently future high-tech is a 90s technology?! How are they going to read the mind of that Guinea pig to find out that Mia is the killer?"
4,16, Okay...what happened there?,1.0,"I'm a fan of the series but this was the best example of the worst 'Phoning it in' I've seen in years! The acting and directing were terrible. It's hard enough to understand with such harsh accents but it seemed that everyone in this episode mumbled their words and lines together like one giant incongruous blob. The plot escalates on a very linear track. They even went for the emotion grab of having an infant killed. This had a striking impact for me since it was the one character that I could both believe and comprehend what he was saying. At the end they used the pet hamster to identify the killer using a memory recall thing. I suppose they had memory recall experts that spoke Cricetidae. 
 
I wish I had a hamster that told me how badly this episode sucked so I could have avoided watching it completely."
4,16, Worst thing I've seen for long time!,1.0,"Honestly I like thrillers, twists, immoral actions and endings. But the events happening in a movie or TV show has to make sense first.This episode is utter nonsense. First off, it's nothing to do with Black Mirror's concept. The technology mentioned has already thoroughly seen in first season and I'd say it's only about 10% of the main events.As for violence and thriller part, it doesn't make sense at all. A short and skinny woman kills everyone with almost bare hands. She can do it because sometimes car doesn't ignite (how creative!) or the guy is taking a shower the moment she breaks in. Ridiculous, simply ridiculous. I've seen much better thrillers have been shot in 60s (talking about worst ones, not Hitchcock). Unfortunately this is what happens when Americans touch a British show. Black Mirror was 3 episode per season and each episode was delightful. Dark, solid and thought provoking. Now, Nexflix orders 6 episode per season and we have to get 3 garbage episodes per season (it was same for season 3). I usually hate giving 1 star to something but I have to flag this crap for people who haven't seen this yet. Beware!"
4,16, Ellen Degenerate and Panoramic winter scenes,1.0,Boring episode...no plot twist... commit a crime to cover up more crimes .
4,17, Lots of ALMOST nudity....so perhaps a good one NOT to watch with your kids or mother or Father O'Reilly!,9.0,"My youngest daughter, an adult, watched this episode of ""Black Mirror"" with me...and I could see that she was clearly embarrassed to have dad watching it with her. Why? Well, because there are quite a few sex scenes. Now you really don't see anything...but it was enough to make my daughter feel mighty uncomfortable!As to the story, it's a very enjoyable and original tale about dating in the future. Frank and Amy meet and go on a date...thanks to a computer device that they carry with them and which tells them who to date and when to end the relationship. The computer keeps reminding each of them that they need to date quite a few people and ultimately the computer will hook them up with the perfect mate. However, apart from the short time they had together at the beginning of the story, both Frank and Amy are miserable following along with the computer. So what ultimately happens? I won't tell you. After all, this would ruin the episode and the interesting twists.Like so many episodes of ""Black Mirror"", this one is highly original and engaging. While you may not love this episode as you sit and watch, keep with it...the ending makes it all worth while and is one of the better episodes."
4,17, Another Sojourn Into Future Technology,8.0,"One of the consistent features of this series is that there is a power, sitting comfortably, somewhere, pulling strings and victimizing people. Even if, in their own view, they are being ""benevolent,"" it's their own benevolence. This episode involves a situation where people voluntarily turn their relationships over to one of these entities. They meet a pre-chosen person and are given a prescribed time to interact with them. It could be for twenty minutes or it could be for three years. At the end, they get their perfect partner. The controllers tell them that everything happens for a purpose. But two young people, after a brief encounter, find they are actually in love. This brings all kinds of things into play. Anyway, it's intriguing. Sex seems to be the biggest thing here. We aren't privy to much else."
4,17," Amy, Frank and the Coach",5.0,"In a dystopic society, romantic encounters are scheduled by the A.I. System The Coach. When Frank meets Amy, they fall in love with each other but are forced to interrupt their relationship as per The Coach instruction and meet other partners. After many ups and downs, Amy and Frank decide to rebel against the system and cross the wall to live together in the wilderness. Will their plan work? ""Hang the DJ"" is a nice and pleasant, but pointless episode of ""Black Mirror"". Georgina Campbell and Joe Cole show wonderful chemistry but the plot has a disappointing and predictable conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Hang the DJ"""
4,17, Spine tingly good 10/10,10.0,"I seem to be reaping huge praise with each continuous episode of this forth series, but this one, I am utterly blown away, this was funny, moving and basically just sublime viewing. Charlie Brooker seriously delivered with this episode, arguably the peak of Series four. It is absolutely packed with emotion, Georgina Campbell and Joe Cole deliver sublime performances, their chemistry is fabulous. What a fabulous idea, it takes the imagination of Charlie Brooker to come up with an idea so wonderful.The future of Black Mirror is in safe hands, this was spellbinding. 10/10"
4,17," ""It's so much simpler when it's all mapped out.""",8.0,"As a love story, I think this one works because the principal characters resolved in the end to be with each other, but I think anyone watching should be troubled by the inherent finality offered by a technology that seems to be accepted as unerring and inviolate. The episode speaks to how much faith younger generations place in 'others' to do the thinking for them so that they don't have to make decisions. We see this present day in the mindless desire to put government in charge of curing all ills, when it really falls to informed individuals to make the right decisions for themselves. There's some inconsistency in the writing as the story plays out. For example, with all the security personnel in place to insure 'couples compliance', why is 'The Wall' designed to have a ladder that allows people to go over it? I can't think of reason for that that would make sense; maybe we weren't supposed to think about it. It also bothered me that Amy (Georgina Campbell) and Frank (Joe Cole) engaged in sexual relationships with their programmed hook-ups when they had no desire for them. OK, I get it, but the whole point was for them to understand their true feelings for each other. I'm actually surprised there was no opt-out provision on those programmed monitors that would allow incompatible couples to break off the timed arrangement sooner. You could require the couples to tap at the same time like they did to find out how long their courtship would last. Simple enough I would think.One might think that my comments suggest I didn't care for the episode. It was okay as far as it goes, but I'm not going to get starry eyed about the whole thing like I see in a lot of the reviews here for it. The whole concept of having things done for you as if you didn't have a mind of your own is really what bothers me about the story. There's always that little bit of something that a technology can't translate properly for it's intended user. If it could, we wouldn't have hundreds of different dating websites."
4,17, Directed by Tim Van Patten,7.0,"Tim Van Patten, half-brother to Dick Van Patten, directs this Black Mirror love story with a twist. Kind of like the acclaimed San Junipero. There's much relationship-testing in this episode, and I was kind of kept guessing until the very end. I was even wondering what the DJ had to do with it."
4,17, 8,8.0,Pretty decent episode with interesting plot but still I prefer more creepier episode where someone dies and etc.
4,17, Future of dating,9.0,"The old-fashioned dating, flirting, and relationships that eat up a lot of our time and nerves, and too often end in unhappy marriages, quarrels, adultery, and divorces, in this ""Black Mirror"" episode are a thing of the past. Here, people are placed in pairing software.The system pairs you a seemingly random number of times with seemingly randomly selected people, for a time that varies from a few minutes to a few years per ""relationship"". You cannot refuse an assigned partner, nor end a relationship before the time allotted by the system has expired, but what you will do in that relationship is up to you. The system monitors and records all events and your reactions to all situations you go through, and when the data collected about you matches the information of one of the other participants, the system pairs you in a perfect pair, with a success rate of 99.8%.But what if the system sentences you to years with a person you can't stand or you fall madly in love with a person assigned to you only for a short time ... Does everything you go through happen for a good reason or is the system not as perfect as it claims to be ...""Hang the DJ"" is another futuristic episode of the ""Black Mirror"" series, which deals with the positive aspects of modern technologies and the negative consequences of over-reliance on them. As usual, it takes some modern trends as a basis and takes them to the extreme. Whether today's dating applications will grow into the system brought to us by this ""Black Mirror"" episode remains to be seen, but we can certainly recognize ourselves in some aspects of this story today.One of the most interesting premises so far, a well-written story, great tempo, and actors who perfectly evoke their characters, with a very charismatic leading couple, and a totally unexpected final twist, make ""Hang the DJ"" one of the best episodes of the ""Black Mirror"" series, and my personal favorite.And no, I'm not going to tell you what the name of the episode has to do with a story like this. For that, you will have to see it through. WTF reaction is guaranteed.9/10."
4,17," Funny, weird, and interesting.",7.0,"Black MirrorHang the DJ (3.5 out of 5 stars).The episode follows a dating program which pairs people up for dates and tells them the expiration of how long their dates or relationship will last. Could be one hour, one year, or years.Frank (Joe Cole) and Amy (Georgina Campbell) fall for each other but the device tells them that their relationship is expired. Which they see others but they do not have the same feeling like they do with each other.Without giving away any spoilers, this episode is kind of interesting. It is creepy about how dating apps are going as of now. The device in this episode is interesting. Which tries to pair people up even if the people dislike each other. There is a big twist in the end which makes more sense but kind of shocking.The episode does get a little slow in the middle with the repetition with Frank being stuck with the same girl that he has nothing in common with nor chemistry. Amy is stuck in short relationships that looks like more hook ups and one night stands. Which she has no feelings for any of the guys she is meeting."
4,17," Cheerful episode, with minor darker undertone",7.0,"Possibly one of the most cheerful episodes where online dating is pushed to its extreme consequences.People can join a service that allows them to try several partners, thus fine-tuning their relationships and finally matching them with someone who is 99.8% compatible.The characters live in a bubble environment and seem to do nothing apart from dining and having sex with their partners. Not a bad life, although something is clearly missing.The plot twist is nothing spectacular, but the story seems to affirm humanity against technology - only it does not really do that, but the opposite. See for yourself."
4,17, Saw everything coming within 20 minutes,2.0,"The main pervading element or issue with many (too many) episodes of Black Mirror is that, with regards to their thematic or moral message, they are painfully unsubtle. Subtlety is often attempted and badly blundered. Things are telegraphed dozens of minutes, sometimes even half an hour ahead.Having watched this episode, I figured out the twist and the theme within the first 20 or so minutes, and was proven correct by the end.Someone got mad at dating sites, apparently too clumsy or buffoonish to figure out the ""algorithms"" used to ""match"" people up by their dating profiles, and took it to its most irrational extreme; a dating service wherein people are randomly paired up by a system, advertised with its 99.8% successful match rate, told how much time they will be together, ranging from a few hours to several years, then must stop being together after that period of time or they get ""banished"" from what is never fully specified. Banished from the dating pool, banished from humanity, sentenced to death, with Black Mirror it can be either, for no clear reason.
the protagonist couple we meet get along incredibly well on their first go-around, and when Amy is set up with her next date, an incredible handsome man for 9 months, and Frank with a woman who absolutely hates him and everything about him for 1 year, I already figured out that the System is going to pair the two of them up again, after having put them through unhappy relationships.What a wizard I am, I figured it out, as Amy slowly grows to dislike her new partner, while Frank's partner is eager to see him off once their time expires, and the two get together in a big, hugely happy, gushy reunion, only this time they agree they will not check to see how much time they're allotted together.
Since this is a television drama, it is inevitable that one of them slips up and goes to check on their time. Frank is the sucker, and sees they have been allotted 5 years. Literally as soon as I saw that, I thought to myself ""Now he's f**ked it up, he's going to cause the relationship to crumble by his knowing how long it will last, and will probably make it end sooner because of how cryptic and oddly he behaves.""
Moments later, the device ""recalibrates"" and sets them to 3 years. Then to 2 years or so. Then 18 months, then keeps going down. I was absolutely right; the fact that he knows when the relationship will end will cause the relationship to end, and much sooner as well.
They then split up with her angrily leaving her, and go back to the dating system where they are paired up in unhappy 12 hour sets with different people. At this point, I thought to myself I've figured it out; the moral of the story is Screw a system, don't let machines dictate your life, just be together regardless, etcetera.
Then Amy and Frank get notifications that they will be paired off with their final ""ultimate"" choice, their chosen ones, etcetera. They then run off, and it's revealed everything that has happened was basically a simulation run by a dating program in the real world, which determined out of 1000 simulations, the two of them defied the system 998 times, thus meaning a 99.8% match for them in the real world, and thus confirming what I had figured out about 8 minutes prior."

Obviously there is no better process to check someone's relationship, if you can see that relationship taking place. If this type of Technology is possible, I wish everybody get that."
4,17, a very nice episode,9.0,"In general I like this show, but I have often felt as though it were a bit too bleak. The ideas are usually interesting, and the production values excellent, but the endings were, to me, often a bit of a bummer.This episode, about a couple attempting to find love using a dating app, is a break from that. The idea is clever; without giving too much away it examines the ""what if"" of how dating apps would work if social interaction analysis were more of an exact science like, say, predicting the weather.The episode is fun, with adult but otherwise relatively light themes and a satisfying story arc. Recommended."
4,17, A desperately needed return to form,8.0,"After some execrable episodes, Brooker finally remembers the premise of Black Mirror and knocks it if not quite out of the park, at least to the boundary.It's not perfect, and the scrawny, scruffy, balding little George Blagden is miscast as a hunk - the reaction to him doesn't match the reality.There's also a slight flaw in the premise in that everything that the protagonists do which isn't directly related to each other isn't really relevant.But that aside, it's a well conceived, cast, written and acted episode with something akin to emotional involvement in the typical Black Mirror shaggy dog story. Such a relief to see it back on form."

The plot is very interesting, and has a relationship with applications to find couples at an extreme level.

Now imagine such a service with the guarantee to match up young people who are searching for true love with a 99.8% perfect match? Too good to be true? What's the catch? Here's how the dating service works: Participants are bound by strict rules, and the decisions of the ""system"" may never be questioned. A ""coach"" may be contacted through a phone gadget all participants carry with them at all times. A major function of this gadget is to offer the participants a clue about the actual duration of each ""relationship"" set up by the dating service, immediately upon first meeting up with a partner. Whether it's only a few hours, or several years, both parties can ""check"" their gadgets for this information. Interesting. We are repeatedly reminded by the coach that ""everything happens for a reason!""Without giving away more of the essential plot elements, l can highly recommend the ""Hang the DJ"" episode as one of the most beautiful love stories I've seen on TV.

4,18," A new, 21st century version of that ""Trilogy of Terror"" sequence with Karen Black.",7.0,"Back in 1975, the made for American TV movie ""Trilogy of Terror"" debuted. Two of the stories were very forgettable but the third became a classic. Karen Black plays a lady who buys a scary looking little doll. Little does she know that it's possessed and will stop at nothing to kill her! And so, for about 30 minutes, Ms. Black is tormented and tormented by this hellish doll. So why do I mention this movie? Well, because in so many ways ""Metalhead"" is an updated and 21st century version of this 70s story.The entire context for this tale is missing. You simply see three people breaking into what looks like an abandoned warehouse. However, they aren't alone...a robotic dog-like sentry is waiting for them. And, when it discovers the intruders it goes into murder mode and seems as if it will never stop. Two are quickly killed...but the third, the woman, is able to escape. But is there any real escape from this dogged robot?This episode will keep your attention and is worth watching. However, I should point out that it's a bit more depressing than usual...and the ending, when it all makes sense, it's REALLY depressing. So my advice is watch...unless you're going through a rough patch...then just watch it later or plan on heading to Disney World or having a party when it's over in order to bring your spirits back to normal!
By the way, unlike other episodes I've seen, this one is in black & white. I think this was done to help hide the CGI and make it all look more realistic.Finally, my daughter told me that this episode and its menacing robot was inspired by a robot featured in the YouTube video entitled ""Hey Buddy, Can You Give Me a Hand?"". And, the similarity is interesting."
4,18, Outer Limits Redux,7.0,"That poor woman. These guys are looking for something to replace something. They go into a warehouse and encounter a ""dog."" I suppose these things were developed initially to guard products. However, they have become killing machines. They don't just protect; they track down and kill. When the thing appears, it kills the man who confronted it, and goes after a woman and her other partner. The story revolves around her efforts to save her life and try to kill the thing. There is a great deal of suspense, but like so many of the more recent ""Outer Limits"" and other ""Black Mirror"" shows, because of circumstances, she never had a chance. These adaptable automatons are really fierce and, even though, they can be destroyed, there are so many."

Clarke drives a van and Bella drives the car, and both are hunted down by the dog. Will they survive?""Metalhead"" is so far the weakest episode of ""Black Mirror"". The plot has no explanation and the viewer only acknowledge that the world is destroyed without any green and controlled by ""dogs"". Are these alien machines? What happened to the population?

4,18," Bleak, action packed, let's your imagination do most of the work.",8.0,"I've never before ever felt so divided about an episode of Black Mirror, I either love them or I don't. Metalhead is for my part the weakest offering of a strong fifth series, but it gains my imagination for its sheer originality, indeed it feels like a stand alone episode from the show, there is nothing really to compare it to. If I were to sum it up in one word it would be bleak, it's bleak from start to finish, it's clinical, sharp, dark, indeed to only soft and cosy thing we get to see are the teddy bears in the final shot. It has a vintage horror feel to it, I think it benefited from its black and white shooting, adds to the overall bleak theme. It's almost like they took a snapshot from a movie, keeping only the action packed ending, we get no explanation, no solution, just the core action. Charlie Brooker invites us into a post apocalyptic world, but allows us to invent for ourselves the cause, was it the AI, or something else? I felt uncomfortable from beginning to end, possibly one of the scariest Black Mirror episodes to date, it's not one I'd visit frequently, but it was certainly a powerful watch. Maxine Peake is outstanding, the emotions she packed into it were brilliant. I think it's an episode that for those that didn't like on first watch, they're sure to want to give it another try. It is certainly thought provoking."
4,18," ""You'll be waiting a long time.""",7.0,"Reviewer 'DissidentRebel' makes a compelling argument for how to understand this episode of Black Mirror, but really, when you come right down to it, the story makes virtually no sense. You have a relentlessly undeterred robotic 'dog' that hunts it's prey to the death, but if you refer back to the beginning of the story, what was it actually that Bella (Maxine Peake) and her two allies were attempting to do in the first place? Retrieve a box full of teddy bears? And for this they were hunted to the death by a giant metallic cockroach? I'm sorry if I can't find the meaning to this episode but it's not really transparent. If there's any kind of takeaway from it, one might consider the possibility that these kinds of drones are being developed that could create unknown havoc once their programming takes over. Useful in wartime against an enemy maybe, but running amok in the countryside hunting people down seems a bit extreme. I liked the idea that this one was done in black and white though. That gave it just the right dystopian feel one expects from a lot of these stories."
4,18," Trim, terrific, taut, tense, terrifying",9.0,"Even though this episode of Black Mirror has one of the lowest iMDB ratings, it has (apart from Bandersnatch) one of the highest number of user reviews, nearly 200.I know some don't like this, but I found this episode gripping. All credit to the location manager for finding a dystopian side to the UK, where this was filmed. The thought of the metal dogs running non-stop was enough to give on pause about technology run amok big time. Anyway, the ending was poignant with the teddy bears. Reminded me of White Bear, the title of an earlier Black Mirror episode.Maxine Peake was superb as the one on the run."
4,18, 4,4.0,"It was too basic for me, lame, without interesting plot or unique idea as other episodes are."
4,18, Nowhere Fast,6.0,"Nowhere FastA group of people moves through a post-apocalyptic landscape in search of something. They are cautious and frightened, all the while waiting for something to attack them. They soon find what they were looking for, but at that very moment they are attacked and from that moment this ""Black Mirror"" episode is in survival mode.Well-directed action scenes alternate with tense moments of calm, keeping you in anticipation. The post-apocalyptic atmosphere is further enhanced by the fact that the episode is in black and white. We don't know who our heroes are, what actually hunts them and why, or what kind of apocalypse has befallen humanity. Along with the tension, curiosity grows. And then the episode ends without revealing almost anything.With a duration of just over half an hour, this is the shortest episode of the ""Black Mirror"" series. Half an hour is not enough to thoroughly work out a story, but that doesn't matter in this case because they didn't even try. While that little we got is acted out, filmed, and directed great, the overall impression is disappointing.The story has no introduction, but throws us directly into action. I had the feeling as if I turned on the TV and bumped into the middle of some tense SF. Technically great and very tense, but I had no idea what it's about. I hoped to understand it by the end, but when it was over I still had no idea what I watched. Protagonists without characterization with whom we have no time or reason to connect and a story that comes from nowhere and leads nowhere.I suppose we all saw ""Terminator 2"". Imagine that you did not and someone shows you the scene in which Edward Furlong on a motorcycle is chased by Terminator. Just that scene, nothing before, nothing after. And that's the whole movie. Although in the context of the film, that scene is one of the best in the history of the genre, standing alone, it is meaningless and cannot represent an independent whole. Well, that's the impression ""Metalhead"" leaves.Besides, I didn't accidentally take the Terminator as an example. ""Metalhead"" can seem original only to those who have not watched even the greatest classics of the genre. The only original thing in this episode is the final twist.""Black Mirror"" is known for unexpected closing twists with a strong message. This episode also has a twist, and it is one of the most unexpected so far, but not because it carries a strong message, but because it is totally insane and unconvincing, and although I can guess which message it wanted to convey, it failed terribly.After watching the ""Black Mirror"" episode ""Metalhead"", I don't have the impression that I saw a short movie, but a long trailer or an insert from some good movie. Unfortunately, we didn't get any context, and all the qualities of this episode are overshadowed by this shortcoming.If the story was on a level with the camera, directing, acting, atmosphere, this would be a strong eight, but because of the story (or lack of it) that does not deserve more than four, my rating is6/10."
4,18," Dark, eerie, and thrilling.",8.0,"Black MirrorMetalhead (4 out of 5 stars).Metalhead is an interesting intense episode in Black Mirror series. The episode is a little bit straightforward without the mindbending twists or shocking ending. It takes place in an apocalyptic world were robotic dogs have taken over. They can adapt, they are weaponized, and they can hunt any living thing. Bella (Maxine Peake) and two others scavenging for medicine comes across one. Which attacks them and is on a prolonged chase to kill them all.The direction does deliver some thrills and gets a bit scary. It was shot in black and white which made it a little more scarier. Feeling like a classic horror movie feel. The episode is very fast paced and intense throughout. David Slade did a great job in delivering this episode."
4,18, AI vs. Humanity,9.0,"Wow what an incredible episode! I can see how most fans wouldn't like episode, especially compared to the others, but what Black Mirror is known for is its unique individual stories based on technology affecting society. This was no different, but more evident.In short (and short and sweet and to the point this episode was), the entire struggle was to obtain something innocent and special for obviously a child, and it shows that human nature will ignore even danger to achieve a goal that will make that child smile... all based on a promise. Its portrays human emotion, kindness, resolve, and much more. Then it shows that technology simply does not care and does what its goal is, no matter what, and in this case its to destroy humanity.You don't need a back story or character development nor plot twists and turns to get the point across as well as this episode did. Barvo! A well deserved 9/10"
4,18," Survival, videogame style... otherwise GAME OVER",2.0,"The shortest and harshest episode, in which we follow the misadventures of three people - soon to be reduced to single survivor Bella.We're thrown right in the middle of the action and we get out without any explanation whatsoever. This did not bother me, since some questions are better left unanswered.What bothered me was the videogame feeling of the episode: indestructible metal dogs that shot people in the head (and make it explode). They chase their prey relentlessly and the prey must find a way to fight back.Otherwise, game over. That's it, basically ... apart form the brief shot of teddy bears, to add ""softness"" - but they could have been just a token to move up one level.PS somebody advanced the idea that, while San Junipero is a sort of paradise - and we briefly see a postcard from San Junipero in the house - this must be hell. I still don't buy this explanation, since the videogame format seems to fit the plot so much better than a random ""hell"". Or, if this is actually ""hell"", then some background story should be given for anybody to care."
4,18, Not Black Mirror's finest hour,6.0,"With an Anthology series there are always hit and miss episodes. Metalhead is certainly not the best of episodes. A woman being chased around by a smart metallic insect for almost an hour with little background story, little dialogue and uninspired scenes was not too impressive. Some great episodes have nicely built up to something but Metalhead fails and is dull throughout. I think the writers needed a space filler episode and this was it. The black and white also does not work well for the episode as it seems even more dull and detached. 6/10"
4,18, Seems like a horror movie...,4.0,"This is one of those episodes whose rating I simply cannot understand. And I'm not going to follow the others who claim that this is a masterpiece because it simply isn't, far from it actually, but on the contrary, I say that it is way too overrated for what it depicts.Let me try to explain myself a bit. In a post-apocalyptic world where robots hunt humans ""for a living"", we find a group of three whose seem more or less determined to enter a storehouse in order to find a specific box for someone whom they know that has only o couple of days left to live. So they seem willing to sacrifice themselves in order to get that box. You might think that they would do such foolishness for something important, but we later find out that the whole risk that they took was only for a teddy bear.Let's say that I can accept this premise (that someone in their situation, in such a dangerous wasteland and in their position of being hunted by deadly robots); although I would do this with great sacrifice, as I find it too hard to believe that somebody mentally sane would actually do that. In this case, it is simply impossible for me to understand what was she (the main character and the only one remaining alive from her party of three) thinking of with every single action she took in order to get back to base. You can add here almost every action she undergoes, from staring without any thought of running when her colleague is slaughtered by a robot to speaking on her walkie-talkie just to send some irrelevant messages while risking exposure, or even going to wash her hands after touching a putrefied corpse instead of running away.I read plenty of comments by other people saying that humans have feelings and that this is the only thing that separates us from robots, and they are right, but I also know that humans have a basic survival instinct, as animals, and are willing to do anything to survive, especially when put into extremely harsh situations as the one depicted in this episode. Thus, all their actions which were emotionally derived couldn't have all been present at the same time to all three characters. I simply cannot believe that. Furthermore, besides feelings, we also have a brain, and intelligence, which should suppress such ridiculous decisions at least from time to time.Bluntly, I saw a bunch of people who seemed to be in a dream or something, who don't realize that they put their own lives into jeopardy (or simply don't care about their lives) for a pointless toy and don't seem willing to do even something remotely intelligent in order to survive. They, and especially she, seem determined to do whatever foolish sentimental action in order to get caught, making the viewer even wish they get caught faster as there isn't any point of prolonging the inevitable death; thus, ending up wishing this as a viewer explains pretty clear how my experience with his episode was. I can even associate it with most horror movies, which have the same traits as this one, from a bad plot to ridiculously stupid characters."
4,18," A short story about nothing, that went nowhere",1.0,"This arbitrary entry into the series sincerely feels like something someone randomly threw on the idea board that no one bothered to whittle down into a concrete story and just ended up filming as-is to meet an episode quota.
it's a minimalistic story of some people in a random post-apocalyptic setting trying to steal something from a warehouse, only to uncover a dog-shaped robot that hunts and kills them with guns and explosive bursts that fill people with shrapnel that it can use as a tracking device to track the person down.One woman survives, and runs from the robot.That's the entire story, without spoiling the ending.
It's exactly the sort of story idea that needed a significant amount of feedback, critique, and rewriting before filming, and on top of all that, it's boring."
4,18, The rotten apple in the barrel,10.0,"OK ! Gonna fess up I marked this a 5 once tbh I'm unsure where my head must have been. After constantly seeing so many rave reviews i kept trying periodically to give it another go but circumstances always distracted. However this had Maxine Peake as the lead so how bad could it be?It wasn't, Metalhead is very intriguing. No back story as to the timeline, no back story as to the why although you get a near tearjerk answer at the end. It's a cat and mouse futuristic without the need of multimillion special FX whilst giving you special FX . A desperate battle in a time I want no part of . I'd rather be peddling for merits.Why in B&W I dont know but it does had a bleakness to the whole event, once again BM as a standalone which could have been extended a little and made into a movie that indy fans would rejoice about.I've never done this before out of 300 reviews but I'm changing my 5 from a couple of years ago to a topping 10"
4,18, It set my heart racing,10.0,"The Dog shaped robot was ferocious and scary. The execution is fantastic, The screenplay is paced perfectly for a thriller. The Lead actress gives out a phenomenal performance. You cannot take your eyes off the screen and you are glued to the screen in anticipation of thrill. I think so far the best episode in Season 4"
4,18, The best episode so far.,10.0,"I was shocked to see this rated so low here. It is by far the best horror episode in Black Mirror I have seen so far. The black-and-white video enhanced the experience because it accentuated the dismal and barren world of the droid dogs. It also made it clearer what was driving the dog, as opposed to shifting focus on landscape and human. That aspect of the production was somewhat confusing. It may have translated better if the whole thing was presented from the robot's point of view. If you have followed the debate on AI and weaponized robotics, you would be impressed with where the writer took this. It is a representation of the mundane use of uplifting technology. And how it can go wrong. I suppose some viewers might not realize how potentially real this bleak future is. That viewer would see this as failing to entertain, because that viewer would be missing the horror of understanding that this could be a real outcome of today's science. My only objection to the writing is the sentimentalism involving the teddy bears. This struck me as a bit retro, a too Twilight Zone. It detracted from the horror of the overall piece."
4,18, How was this not a 10 minute short?,2.0,"Do you want to watch a woman rummage through an entire house in what seems like real time, like you're watching a live stream of someone with OCD playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds? Then look no further.We are given zero context with regards to both setting and characters (although one might argue that this episode doesn't really contain any characters, only plot functions). Sometimes holding back this type of information is crucial to the story because it will pay off later. My favorite Black Mirror episode ""White Bear"" is a prime example where this works beautifully. But in Metalhead there is no payoff, no explanation coming. What has happened to the world that made it into an post-apocalyptic wasteland? Screw you, that's what.Who were these people? Screw you, that's who.Why was this warehouse seemingly stuffed to the rafters with teddy bears guarded by murderous robot dogs hellbent on killing anyone intruding, and apparently willing to follow someone to the ends of the world in order to complete its mission? Because screw you, that's why.But perhaps it not about characters or story, but simply the visceral thrill? Well, then color me unimpressed. I couldn't wait for this elongated foot chase to be over and done with, hoping for a payoff that would never come.However, in its favor, watching a knife wielding robot dog try to murder someone was hilarious. But I'm not sure that was the feeling they were going for."
4,18, Scary,10.0,"Metalhead has a very simple story. We watch a woman fleeing from a murderous robotic ""dog"". It is, for me, the most frightening episode so far...and also quite disturbing. I also like the black and white effect."
4,18, Comme ci comme ca,5.0,"Not the best of the series of Black Mirror admittedly. Still, it kept me watching until the end to see what happens. Then I'm still none the wiser. She cuts her throat and we end on a box of teddy bears!! Why?! I'm trying to think outside of the box here but still can't understand it all. The dogs were initially a toy for kids and went rogue?"
4,18, Excellent in its minimalism,9.0,"A superb episode which benefits enormously by being shot in black and white, having very little dialogue, and refraining from giving any explanations of why the world is as it is. Less is most certainly more in this case. We don't need an explanation of why hunting robot dogs are running around killing any living thing, what happened to everyone, and where the people in the film have come from. These days viewers seem to like being spoon-fed everything - something that can clearly be seen when reading the low-rating comments. It's called ""using your imagination"". We need more of it."
4,19, Rolo Haynes is one very unusual man....,9.0,"""Black Mirror"" is an anthology show a bit like ""The Twilight Zone"" but also much darker and with an emphasis how near-future technology can make our lives horrid. This episode clearly is about the horrid.When the story begins, a young lady arrives at a crappy little museum in the middle of the desert. The place is called 'The Black Museum'...a term inspired by the British Black Museum of crime and criminals that actually does exist. She is soon shown in by the owner, Rolo Haynes...a guy who seems to really enjoy frightening his patrons and regaling them with stories of misery and death. Unlike other episobdes I've seen of ""Black Mirror"", this one consists of several short stories--all horrid and all which in some way involved Rolo in his old job of selling strange technology to folks at a hospital. I could summarize the three tales but frankly you're better off just seeing them and being surprised.Throughout his little tour of his chamber of murder and horror, Rolo seems to enjoy this very much. In many ways, he's at least partially responsible for much of the misery and you hope that there is an accounting for his actions. And, don't worry...there certainly is!
As with many episodes of the series, the only problem with it is that at times it's too vivid and too grotesque. This is NOT a show for children and the easily offended!! Still, like so many episodes it's incredibly imaginative and well written...and well worth seeing."
4,19, Almost Too Much to Watch,10.0,"This was bit remindful of the new version of the Outer Limits, where a last episode was a compilation of previous ones. However, we are taken on a ride of cynicism unparalleled. The proprietor of the Black Museum, Rolo, is the worst of the worst. He is psychotic and predatory and a genius at what he does. Since this is really three stories that come together, his storytelling abilities and his drooling excitement at the pain he has created, make it right for this series. A young, strong black woman stops to charge her car (solar powered) but her agenda brings her to a ""Black Museum."" This museum is a tourist trap that features all manner of human agony. Rolo, apparently, has participated in horrors to various human subjects. There is a doctor who has good intentions when he is implanted with a device to feel his patients' pain and, hence, diagnose them. Then there is a woman dies but is connected to her partner in a kind of ethereal worlds. Finally, a man condemned to death in the electric chair. The stories are sick but engaging. But what makes this work is a well rounded plot line that brings all of this into play. I guess I will have t wait for a while to see if another set of these comes around."
4,19, Dark Tale,9.0,"While driving to celebrate her father´s birthday, Nish stops at a lonely station to recharge the batteries of her car and walks to the criminal Dark Museum before the opening hour. However the owner Rolo Haynes admits Nish and tells the dark story related to each object. The air conditioning is out of work and Haynes drinks a bottle of water provided by Nish. Soon he learns who she is and what he agenda is.""Dark Museum"" is a dark tale and one of the best episodes of ""Black Mirror"". Each segment is attractive but the lead story is very creepy and the conclusion surprises the viewer. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Dark Museum"""
4,19, Astonishing,10.0,"What a way to round of a superb series of Black Mirror. I'll admit my anticipation levels were high for this one, and I was not left disappointed. Instantly this was absorbing, it unfolded in real style, loaded with twists and turns, captivating viewing from start to finish. Technology used in true Black Mirror style, used to make a wonderfully twisted, but human story. Fabulous acting from all, Letitia Wright was fabulous throughout, particularly at the end. I've always been a big fan of Douglas Hodge, he seems to have been off the radar somewhat, so it was great to see him back, he was excellent, impressed by his accent too . At times it felt like a seventies portmantaeu film, lots of stories within a story, all combining at the end, similar in layout to 'From beyond the Grave.' This one seemed bigger and bolder, had the feeling of a quality film about it. Very impressed."
4,19," ""Hey, don't worry. We're going to see you on the other side.""",8.0,"I was on guard the entire time watching this episode because I thought at some point, Rolo Haynes (Douglas Hodge) was going to do something nasty with or to the somewhat stranded motorist Nish (Letitia Wright). The tables are turned at the finale when Nish gets her 'revenge' against Rolo for turning her father into a virtual reality game, one of the premier attractions of the Black Museum. That was another bit of misdirection as well, the title of the story hinted at a racial component, but that's something that never really entered the picture. The three part format was reminiscent of Season Two's 'White Christmas', and now that I write about it, there's an interesting dichotomy there with Black/White. Pretty interesting, don't you think? Of the three stories, it's hard to tell which one was the most disturbing. One of the neat things about the episode was the way it wove elements of prior season stories into this one. As an example, widower Jack (Aldis Hodge) is shown reading a comic book adaptation of 'Fifteen Million Merits' in the second segment. There are more for astute viewers, and actually, that's one of the clever things about the series that writer Charlie Brooker does to keep viewers engaged and returning."
4,19, Both excellent and not. The results are... It's good!,8.0,"My initial reaction to the season 4 finale of Black Mirror was that it was good - I can barely think of one episode that wasn't at least trying something intriguing or questioning our perceptions of the world thru our technology in some form... And yet I found this mean spirited piece of business with a hammy lead performance....(One hour later) after pondering some more, so appreciate that this structure is similar to White Christmas but the nastiness lends itself more to something like CREEPSHOW: here are people who get twisted by the technology that they are given by this doctor-cum-carnival barker, but that doesn't excuse how far two out of three of these subjects abuse what they are given and end up going for the worst in humanity. The last subject in this museum is a guy who rides the lightning and his consciousness in computer form has to relive it over and over. I might question how a computer entity can feel pain and become mentally fractured by it, but this is also a season that began with a video game programmer using the DNA of his coworkers to warp them in simulated space madness, so it is consistent. I think the hamminess of this guy, how sweaty he gets, his general demeanor, is too much in the moment and yet of all the episodes this is one I want to watch again the most. It's sick in its humor (that one doctor and what he does with his pain receptor is the best part for me, I could have done with a whole episode about him, or seen him crop up in a Philip K Dick short novella or something) and it leaves on a note of that is not depressing. It's just... Trying so hard."
4,19, Tales from the Darkside,8.0,"This season 4 finale is very moving, dealing with themes of sex and pain (Daniel Lapane bouncing), race, brain implants, death penalty and revenge. There are numerous Easter Eggs galore in this episode that refer to previous Black Mirror episodes. There are a trilogy of stories in Black Museum, all connected to each other. One of the final scenes was very poignant, where the plush money chimes ""Monkey loves you"".Douglas Hodge, a British actor, masters the American accent quite well, as he did later when he played a criminal defence lawyer in The Undoing.Can't wait to watch Bandersnatch and season 5."
4,19, 9,9.0,"Epic episode, really loved it interesting plot and how it was fulfilled"
4,19, Tales from the Black Mirror,8.0,"With its structure, story, and most of all its atmosphere, the ""Black Museum"" irresistibly resembles the cult anthologies of the eighties, such as ""Creepshow"", ""Tales from the Darkside"", ""Tales from the Crypt"", and to some extent Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"".A young black woman rides an old-timer on a dusty road, which suggests a retro episode. But when she stops at a gas station, we see her plugging a car into a solar panel. This kind of charging will take quite a while, so she decides to explore the nearby facility, to pass the time.The building in question is the Black Museum, which, with the black woman in the lead role, again leads to wrong assumptions. It is a museum of various technological achievements related to crimes. We had the opportunity to see a good part of the exhibits in previous episodes of the ""Black Mirror"" series, but this episode does not focus on them, so they can easily go unnoticed and represent the ""easter eggs"" of this episode.The Black Museum focuses on three exhibits we have not encountered so far. The curator of the museum, a person of a very suspicious character, tells our heroine the history of these exhibits, so in this episode, we have a triptych of short, but powerful and quite shocking and morbid SF dramas. Each of these stories opens new questions about human psychology and attitudes towards technical achievements and makes us think, and each for itself would be a worthy episode of the ""Black Mirror"" series. And when you finally, through the final twist, see how all three stories are connected, to each other and the background story, the episode becomes even more striking.Although the twist is quite unoriginal and towards the end it becomes more and more predictable, and there is no tension typical for most ""Black Mirror"" episodes, everything is so nicely blended and works perfectly that the shortcomings are negligible. And in my case, the similarities with the anthologies of my childhood add another nostalgic star to the final rating.8/10."
4,19, One of the best this season.,8.0,"Black Mirror
Black Museum (4 out of 5 stars).The episode does have a bit of a mind-bending story which does let the audience contemplate right after it finishes. It has a story within a story concept. It follows Nish (Letitia Wright) driving across country and she comes across a black museum. Which holds all the advanced technology on exhibit. Rolo (Douglas Hodge) gives her a tour. Telling three stories. One about a device implanted in the head that you can feel how another person is feeling. The second one implanting a comatose person into another persons body. So she can still be part of the family. And the last one following a criminal being executed and being digitized.Without giving away any spoilers, the episode does have a twist that works well and ties the stories together. They all have something in common and with the character Nish and her mysterious backstory. The episode does get a bit disturbing with the one story of a doctor using a device to feel another persons pain. While his obsession of pain gets worse. And he starts to inflict pain onto himself was a bit dark. The other stories can be scary and disturbing with the idea of being stuck for eternity into someone else's mind as a backseat pilot.Overall, this episode delivers. Black Mirror Season 4 overall I would rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars. It may be running low on fresh ideas with technology and its impact. It just not as mindbending or twisted how the previous seasons were."
4,19, Season Four,10.0,"The first two seasons of Black Mirror were intriguing, but focused far too much on the technology and far too little on the stories/characters. The third season mostly remedied this problem, but those episodes were still a bit uneven. This Fourth Season, however, Black Mirror takes a major step forward by producing six episodes that are all supremely entertaining in their own way.There's no letdown in the lot of them this time. Even the ""black sheep"" of the bunch, ""Metalhead"", is still an exciting action/adventure romp at its worst. What's really amazing too is the breadth of each individual episode. From Star Trek spoof to the repercussions of tracking implants, or online dating to memory harvesting, this season mines from so many different avenues. Fittingly, this season's finale, Black Museum, serves as a sort of retrospective of all that has come so far.Early on while reviewing the first season of this show, I made the comparison of how it is tough to evaluate this show because it will always be in the shadow of The Twilight Zone for a certain sect of viewers. Black Mirror started breaking through that barrier in Season 3, and crashed through it here. This is about as quality of an anthology series season as one will ever find."
4,19, Closing with a major downer,1.0,"Looks like they run out of ideas for Black Mirror and what we get here is a major mashup of other episodes + a political correct statements that sort of misfires.As mentioned by another reviewer, the title of this should have been ""White Christmas Bear Will Be Right Back"", since the main themes are: trapped consciousness. punishment for crimes and dealing with death.Not only the content is recycled but also the format: as in ""White Christmas"" three stories are told by the main male character, related to exhibits in the Black Museum - and let me add that the plot synopsis on IMDb is as misleading as writing that Titanic is a ""romantic love story taking place on a luxury cruiser"".Since this was a very woman-centric season, one should already guess that the male character is bad. Moreover the female character is Afro-American, which screams out ""good"".The stories are creepy and disturbing in equal degree. Perhaps the last, about people enjoying ""executing"" a death row prisoner and getting a ""token"" of the execution, just a bit more than the others.However, the final message we get out of this is that sadism and revenge are OK if you belong to a certain race/gender, while not OK for others, which I found extremely disturbing. Maybe because I am so old fashioned to find violence and sadism disturbing, no matter who the perpetrator is.Anyway, looks to me like it's time to shut down the whole BM operation, since they started recycling big time and don't have anything else to say."
4,19, Black Museum: HOW much blacker can you get?,10.0,"**Review may contain slight spoilers**Jesus; this episode... this EPISODE! Black Museum just might be one of the very best episodes of television I've ever seen; and that's saying something in my books. I love Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Sherlock, Doctor Who and of course Black Mirror. However, it takes something truly special to have a single episode stand-out from the crowd in general, because whole shows like Black Mirror tend to be fantastic overall. The series is one of the best science fiction stories on television, and it arguably transcends the likes of The Twilight Zone for some. The revelations in this episode, the twists, and the sub-plots are all amazing, adding to one of the best Black Mirror reveals to date.And much to my surprise, this episode actually had some moving moments as well. Considering the stuff Black Mirror usually covers, I didn't expect to be moved the way I did. I take my hat off to Charlie Brooker for this one. He's now become one of my favourite writers.Want some truly smart sci-fi? Look no further. Black Museum is a classic!"
4,19, This episode is SO bad!,2.0,"Was it a nostalgia thing? Because BLACK MUSEUM is hardly deserving of it's lofty rating here. In fact, it's exactly the nostalgia as to why this episode is actually one of the worst of the series. Instead of being original and telling it's own story, like every single other episode of the series, instead it opts to go 4th wall and shamelessly ingratiate itself to the viewer with all these Easter Eggs. It was overkill. Admittedly, the style was interesting as it had a ""Tales from the Crypt"" vibe, but the stories were really silly for the most part and the acting was really atrocious, including by Letitia Wright, who undeservedly got an Emmy nomination for this? Even though Season 4 was subpar overall, there were WAY more deserving actors than her in this awful episode. It looks like Wright got the nod mostly because she was popularized in the huge Black Panther hit film that coincided with this episode. But her acting was bad, as was the acting of virtually every actor in this episode. The worst offenders were in the second vignette by the 2 actors playing the interracial married couple. For most other actors, it was more bad writing, but with this duo, it was REALLY bad acting! The narrator guy, the self-serving Rolo, was actually kind of entertaining, thus the extra star, but much too 1-dimensional. The only reason for even tying all prior episodes to this one is if this were the last of the series, BUT Season 5 is coming at the end of this year. So that means that this episode was a complete waste of time. So it's not just filler, it's bad filler. Regardless of the rating, I think this is the actual worst episode of the season and one of the worst of the series."
4,19, fun stuff,8.0,"Rolo Haynes is a great storyteller and a spectacular museum guide. his museum deserves better than what it's got as we start off the episode.
Story 1 was just hilarious. It was also the sort of thing that could work without the technological theme of the series, but the tech aspect makes it easier for the doctor to dig deeper into his addiction without having to kill or maim (although it ends up getting to that point at the very end). It had me laughing many times all throughout.
Story 2 was more standard ""Black Mirror"" fare, complete with people making bad decisions I could easily see coming an hour away. In this case, the bad decision of a wife, Carrie, stepping out into a street without looking and getting hit by a truck and put into a coma leads to the monumentally bad decision of exploiting the tech that was introduced in the first story, now refined to allow a transference of someone's digital consciousness. Rather than transfer her mind into a donor body, they make the monumentally bad decision to transfer her mind into her husband Jack's brain, and killing her body so they can't ever go back in case this monumentally stupid decision turns out to be a disaster, which it does. So now, instead of her living on in another body to be with him, she lives in his head like an imaginary friend. So now she can only see and feel what he sees and feels and he talks out loud to her, resulting in him constantly talking out loud.Hilarity ensues. Tragedy also ensues, but with how emotionally hamfisted Black Mirror tends to be, it was mostly hilarity. The funniest part of all this is he gets a new girlfriend and she knows his wife is inside his head so she can yell at his wife by yelling in his face.As an aside, it's hinted at near the end of the story that the wife in his head isn't actually his wife---she's dead---but an AI copy in his head that can be ""paused"" for days, months, or even years at a time.As the relationship starts to fall apart, but being unwilling to DELETE his head-wife, he has her consciousness implanted into a stuffed monkey for her son, leaving her with only the capability of simplistic responses out loud, limited to ""Monkey loves you"" and ""Monkey needs a hug"".So they move on with their lives, the man with his new girlfriend, while leaving the wife trapped in the monkey forever.This is meant to be a tragic, sad sort of story, but I just found it utterly hilarious all throughout. The AI wife is even still in the monkey at the museum.
Story 3 is where you start to grow to dislike Rolo Haynes, as he acts a bit shady and starts lying in his story, dehumanizing in his description while the film sequence often shows the opposite.While this story is rather dull on its own, it is the culmination of the various pieces of technology introduced in the previous two stories (the transference of pain from one mind to another, the transference of consciousness from one mind to a digital device) leading to him making a sentient digital version of an executed killer able to feel pain, letting people come to the museum to personally ""execute"" the digital copy in a digital electric chair, even making an even tinier digital copy as a souvenir for visitors to take home in some incoherent sadism.
Then we get the conclusion of the framing narrative, as its revealed the woman visiting the museum was the daughter of the digital man in Story 3, exacting vengeance and giving a typically Black Mirror hamfisted morality diatribe about sadism, exploitation, and buzz word outrage activists who initially rallied in support against the exhibit, then get bored and move on to ""the next viral outrage"", before subjecting him to some ironic revenge.
The ending was overly long and wordy, but overall it was a fun ride."
4,19, OMG😂😂😂,10.0,So freakin crazy😂😂😂. Stick with it and give it 20 minutes. It takes that long for story to develope. Just a wild story telling ride. Awesome episode no question about it!!!
4,19, Black Mirror Easter Egg Hunt,10.0,"Nope the first time I watched this I had no idea of the twist. I did reckon there was something a foot as the tour progressed and the guide began to sweat and when it came to the star attraction I did take on board ... well it would become a spoiler but let's say this story was discussed in different terms from the others.But the other thing is to look out for all the stuff from other episodes so this must be way into the future in the BM timeline, I mean way into when you actually walk around but that's for you to find.One of the best episodes, like White Christmas a series of stories within a main feature story.Ten without a doubt"
4,19, Perfect Finale,9.0,Season 4 ends perfectly. The acting is brilliant. The writing is flawless. You do not know what to expect. The twist in the end is fantastic. The episode has a few stories in one story and all the stories have a WTF moment. The shock factor of this show is awesome. Looking forward to more.
4,19, Twisted thriller.,10.0,"Ok talking about the history of Black Mirror, this was the second best episode of Black mirror ever after White Christmas and obviously White Christmas was a Special episode, so I think this is the best episode of any season in Black Mirror history.
The story was really totally connectable ride of tech and pain. All three Techs were superbb but I think the first one was kind of silly, I mean someone got hungry of pain😥😥. This one I can't understand.
Whatever the other two Techs and there connectivity with the main story was pretty good. I enjoyed the main story line and story telling."
4,19, Disappointing bait-and-switch,6.0,"The first 2/3rds of this episode is a masterclass in compelling storytelling, everything we've come to love about Black Mirror.Then there an abrupt plot twist that throws it all away, and turns it into a tawdry, predictable little revenge piece.The take-away is that Letitia Wright is a weak, talentless hack with little screen presence or ear for accents. We saw that in Black Panther wid her Wakandan speeken like dis, bruda, and it's really not much better here.If Brooker had stuck to what he wanted to make rather than what he clearly felt compelled to make, this could have been great. As it was, I just turned it off with ten minutes to go, as Wright wrecked it."
4,19, The Greatest episode in black mirror after white Christmas!,10.0,"Literally it was entertaining and Fun,starting felt lite tone and then the end it was outta nowhere it was damn shocking and amazing,the references of previous episodes and the museum it was phenomenal,the music was great,the two humans living in one thing it was mind-blowing and brilliantly written!Overall it was one of the most amazing episode!"
4,19, Okay,4.0,"So take the episode White Christmas, this is essentially the same episode but watered down big time. It was okay but nothing all that special."
5,20, Endless,4.0,"This is an episode that I thought would never come to a conclusion. When it did, I couldn't care less. What these guys went through was of no consequence to anyone. Getting into a dream state through a video game is possible I guess, but it just took forever to resolve anything."
5,20, Virtual Gays,7.0,"Former college friends and videogame fight fans Danny (Anthony Mackie) and Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) reunite many years after in Danny´s birthday at his place. Danny is married with a child with Theo (Nikki Beharie) and Karl gives a state-of-art update of the former fight game to his friend. During the night, they select the former characters Roxette (Pom Klementieff) and Lance (Ludi Lin) and out of the blue they have a romance instead of a fight affecting their private lives and malehood.""Striking Vipers"" is one of the weirdest ""Black Mirror"" episodes, with an erotic tale about the virtual world affecting the real world of the two lead characters in their addiction. There are funny situations but something is missing in the intriguing story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Striking Vipers"""
5,20, It's been a long wait.,7.0,"I definitely wouldn't say it's a favourite, but it does have a very profound message, can you fall in love with more then just the physical. It has you confused at times, as you question sexuality, love, romance etc.Some people do genuinely live in a cyber reality, where life can perhaps seem a little simpler, this episode certainly looks into the divide between real life and cyber reality.Very well acted, and well produced, I'd argue the most bizarre episode to date, but it's certainly enjoyable.It's always great to see a new episode of Black Mirror. 7/10."
5,20," ""That the best you can do, man?""",7.0,"I just read where the series creator, Charlie Brooker, is not working on a sixth season of ""Black Mirror"" because we, as a society, have already become too dystopian in reality, and he feels that life is bleak enough without creating more shows that could get you even more depressed. I don't know if 'Striking Vipers' is one to get you all that depressed, but with it's gender bending plot, it's a story that could certainly have best friends looking at each other in an oddly different way. The program was probably a little longer than it needed to be to make it's point, and felt padded out with the repeated immersions into the virtual reality world of Roxette (Pom Klementieff) and Lance (Ludi Lin), and by proxy, that of the two principals, Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), and Danny (Anthony Mackie). The resolution to the story brings the best friends back to reality though, even if in unconventional fashion. This one will make a lot of guys watching it queasy enough, and if seeing it together with your best bud, might even produce an unexpected reaction or two."
5,20," Politically incorrect: Danny, Karl and Theo too",6.0,"This season 5 opener has a huge number of iMDB user reviews, and I can understand why. This is kind of like San Junipero but with a ""Danny, Karl and Theo too"" twist that gives a new meaning to open marriages and male bonding I guess. The ending is uncomfortable for some to be sure, but I guess Charlie Brooker felt confident with the reception to San Junipero.The scenes in Sao Paulo, where this episode was filmed, captures the atmosphere. Japantown is used to powerful effect."
5,20, Is porn cheating?,7.0,"Opinions are divided. Some consider porn to be a form of infidelity in serious relationships, while others consider it a harmless way of giving vent to oneself that no one should be blamed for.But what if the development of VR technology makes pornography interactive content that provides a complete physical experience without physical contact? This is one of the questions that the ""Black Mirror"" episode ""Striking Vipers"" asks us.However, this episode is not about pornography.The two roommates, who were actively playing a video game similar to ""Tekken"" or ""Mortal Kombat"" in college, meet again after eleven years. One started a family, while the other still refuses to grow up, and, as a birthday gift for his old friend, he brings the most modern VR version of the game that they enjoyed in their boyhood days.The game, as expected, involves a chip on the temple and completely puts you in a VR environment, where you have a complete experience of brutal fights, but without consequences for your real body. The two take the same avatars they used in college, but as one of the avatars is female, they soon discover that ""Striking Vipers"", in addition to fighting, provides other physical experiences.Given that they are both men, does this make them gay, even though one of the avatars is female? Is a man who uses a female avatar a transsexual? Is their virtual sex a relationship or just playing a VR game among friends? Does this mean that the married one cheats on his wife? How many men would like to live through the experience of a female orgasm firsthand?In addition to the obvious question of how much the escape from reality into virtual life is a harmless break from everyday life or a dangerous addiction, there is a bunch of questions that lead to thinking and introspection, while we wait for some shocking outcome, to which the series ""Black Mirror"" accustomed us. What will be the message/lesson/social critique this time?A very intriguing and controversial premise, which opens up countless possibilities for a striking episode. Unfortunately, although it is excellently filmed and acted, with good characterization and overall atmosphere, ""Striking Vipers"" is not going anywhere. Instead of a shocking plot twist, we got a disappointingly lukewarm compromise outcome, which leaves a bland taste in the mouth.7/10."
5,20, What the actual F?,7.0,"This is such a weird episode and definitely is futuristic, the person that said that is wrong! Also the person that was saying look up awkward is a genius that made me laugh out loud. I guess in the future of VR we'll have love making in video games. Probably in the top weirdest Black Mirror episodes ever!"
5,20, A decent start of the season.,6.0,"Striking Vipers (3 out of 5 stars).It was a decent start of the season. The episode plot follows Danny (Anthony Mackie) and Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) lifelong friends. Huge gamers. As years go by, they drifted apart. Danny is married and they are trying for children. Karl is living the single life and meeting girls through a dating app. Karl and Danny attempt a Virtual Reality Striking Vipers game. Which puts them both right into action. A fighting game that looks like Dead or Alive or Tekken. When they fight in a round. Karl playing as a female fighter and Danny as a guy fighter. While in VR, one event in the game leads to another which can impact how their reality.I can't give away anymore about the plot without entering spoiler territory. But when one event happens in VR. It was literally a WTF moment. it was not anything surprising or shocking. The story was decent. Not one of Black Mirrors best storylines. It does test the concept idea of a married guy's life and how exciting the life used to be. When VR is used, every possibility is endless. It does draw the line of how far can one thing go without having any consequences of affecting the people around you.It was a slow moving direction. The episode started a bit slow. Showing Danny and his girlfriend having a role playing with their relationship. A decade later, he feels burned out with his life. Same with his wife, were she feels like she is no longer attractive to him. The script and direction is slow moving and can be boring at times.It was a fair episode. Nothing surprising or shocking with its story. The cast was good. Just a bit boring."
5,20, Brilliant episode!,9.0,"Wow a lot of whiny uncomfortable reviews... get a grip people, this is 2019, get over it! Brilliant writing, directing and casting. And I don't get why people don't understand the ending... y'all never heard of a ""hall pass""? Brilliant, just brilliant all around. It's an honest and well deserved 9/10 from me!"
5,20, Gay?,8.0,Striking Vipers is one of the most awkward episodes of television ever. It's also funny. And entertaining. And good acting!
5,20, Superb start and in typical Black Mirror style,8.0,"After the long wait Black Mirror has returned and it didn't disappoint with its first episode. The usual clashBlack Mirror has to be one of the greatest shows in television due to its dark and creative nature. We got this in the 1st episode. Solid performances from a cast which you could believe could be a whole tv series of its own such is the great pacing and depth. As usual it explores hard and conflicting emotions as two friends struggle with feelings that they only experience in VR. Only in BM will you see such emotions and complexity play out. The two don't know how to reconcile their virtual interactions with real life, what does it really mean? Great episode and solid start.8.5/10"
5,20, Weird but entertaining enough,7.0,Boy I was glad I didn't watch this with my dad like usual would of been even more awkward. Interesting concept that strangely enough I could see happening if it was possible amongst many people. Could have had a more important or exciting topic/story though.
5,20, Missing the point uncomfortably.,7.0,"This was obviously a weird uncomfortable watch for many who found the vehicle of delivery too obscure to get the general point, and the point wasn't that obscure if you weren't reeling from the straight guys do gay whammy.
Their relationship was internet titillation of any kind, be it bog standard porn draining the sexual energy (""I'm just tired""), and attention (""real life doesn't do it for me anymore"", ""I'm sorry I don't think I can"", ""do you mind if I finish my self off""?- pulls out screen etc etc), and video games, obviously also draining time and energy away from the real world. The gay not gay aspect was an add on which felt like it kind of overtook the whole episode and you can make of that what you will. There was insight in that concept too.
For all those crying ""This isn't Black Mirror!!!"" this one was as Charlie Brooker black mirror as the prime minister and the pig first episode. It was weird, thought provoking and slightly uncomfortable to watch with your mum."
5,20, Beautiful story so well written. With nice touches,10.0,"CHARLIE BROOKER I LOVE YOU another fantastic episode where the future meets vintage and tackles subject matter with such sensitivity. Talking dishwasher, nice little background touch along with the paper thin phones. (Not a spoiler as nothing to do with story)"
5,20, Starts and ends on the same shock value.,2.0,"This episode was only shock value and nothing more. The characters start off experimenting with sexuality in VR. And then the show ends with the characters experimenting with sex in vr.. The characters never experiment more or evolve or change in any way as people. They stay the same stagnant characters from start to finish. I was shocked at first...but then nothing else happened. And in the end the only redeeming part was the acting. I felt like all the actors were really in that situation..
If only we had an explanation for why the sex was better with his friend than it was with his wife or with other people... Why did the wife not play the game with her husband? If the friends had such a strong connection why was it never shown at all? I think i would have ended it with the married couple breaking up and the two guys getting married...even though they are straight in the game they can get their sexual needs fulfilled completely."
5,20, It's a metaphor.,6.0,"On the surface this story is one of two old friends from college getting it on in an online fighting game. Obviously the makers of the game had something like this in mind otherwise they wouldn't have programmed it in but that's just a nitpick.The real message is how technology and things like video games can matter more to us and be more ""real"" than what happens in real life.Is it awkward? Yes. It is. Very much so. But it's also showing us the effects of such an addiction in a way that normally we wouldn't see. It's not about two dudes getting it on in VR. It's about two dudes using VR as an escape from their real lives and indulging in a little bit of fantasy. It's not harmless. It shows the real world effects of getting too into your games.Try to look beyond the awkward. There's a story there trying to get out."
5,20, Nonsense,1.0,"What utter tripe. Nothing in it makes sense at all, more nonsense just to make a point"
5,20, 5x01,9.0,"Going by the rating of this episode, I thought it was boutta be mid, but it was a very very pleasant surprise because I thought it was brilliant. The start was a bit shaky, which a lot of BM episodes are because they don't exactly have much time to set up the premise of the episode so I'm not that fussed. Once we get into it though, it really is a captivating concept. I think this episode has perfectly encapsulated the complexity of human sexuality through the use of technology without reducing it or demeaning it. Pair that with a very well written and performed marriage, this was an episode about the complexity of relationships too. A lot to manage in 60 minutes, but they managed. Watching the two men as their video game counterparts was a layered experience and it does just make you wonder. It sounds childish to say that but it genuinely does. I think one drawback is that I don't think we really saw as much of the complexity when actually inside the game but again there's only so much you can fit into an hour. Overall this was just a really believable, genuine, three-dimensional and most of all human story, which happened to also be excellently shot and scored. Out of the other romantic episodes of BM (San Junipero and Hang the DJ) I think this one is the best by far, and one of my favourite episodes of the whole show. I don't have enough good things to say about it reallyMid 9"
5,20, Asks yourself a question you may not answer in public,8.0,"Moralistic episode where you could debate long into the small hours what is right and what is wrong.
But at the end of the Day
This is not reality, not yet anyway ...Good soild episode."
5,20," Very interesting, but it was a little slow at times",7.0,"I don't know why some people hate this episode, I guess it makes some uncomfortable with its plot but I found it very interesting and engaging enough to keep me watching.The cast were all fantastic as expected but it did feel as though the episode dragged on longer than it needed to"
5,20, Great,9.0,"Black Mirror is known for its unusual stories. Striking Vipers is a great story, odd and inventive. I don't want to say more because I don't want to spoil the fun but surely you won't get disappointed by this episode."
5,20, Funny AF,6.0,This is the funniest episode of Black Mirror ever.
5,20," Cool idea, weird approach",7.0,"The idea of the episode is decent enough, but never really takes off. There are a few too many weaknesses in the plot, and an overall feeling that this is just not Black Mirror worth material.First of all, the whole idea that this VR faux Tekken game quickly turns into porn is arguably the most realistic BM has ever been - but the notion that this technology which just came out is so advanced that it simulates sex perfectly (even though it wasn't made for that!) is rather hard to sell. Secondly, the fact that the protagonists only want each other in the VR is rather odd - to be fair, the script does try to address the obvious question ""why can't you just hook up with a gazillion online users"" but does so unconvincingly, with a bland ""it's just not the same"".All in all, the concept here is interesting, but what you expect from Black Mirror is probably a world where everyone is addicted to VR sex, neglecting real life - not a ""hah, here is a fancy way to demonstrate that sexuality is a fluid concept"" story."
5,21, Quite Gripping,9.0,"This is a really intense presentation of a man who has come to the end of his rope. After he death of his only love, he sees the indifference of society, largely their unyielding focus on their phones and electronics. They speak in cyber babble and forsake humanness. He kidnaps a young man who works for a firm that has advanced that technology, and demands to speak to the founder. It's an incredible lesson for us all and it pulls no punches."
5,21, The wow episode.,10.0,"As always, every series has a wow episode, one that you watch, and say Yes! This was that episode, an hour of pure brilliant, engaging, charged and moving drama.It feels slightly at odds with the usual formula of the show, back in time (albeit only a year,) for the first time, and for once we don't get the usual forms of possible future technology, just a social media platform, similar to one many of us are used to.I thought the story was awesome, so good that two super talented names, Andrew Scott and Monica Dolan were brought in. Scott has a habit of standing out from his peers, as does Dolan, but here Andrew Scott is incredible, his performance will blow you away.It's such a relevant story for today's day and age, with a hugely powerful message.Wonderful. 10/10"
5,21," ""Your mind may wander. Simply watch it go.""",8.0,"One's life can change in the blink of an eye, an immeasurable second that passes instantly, leaving unintended consequences in its wake. This was Chris Gillhaney's (Andrew Scott) fate and his curse. Having crossed his own personal line in the sand, Gillhaney knew that his life was forfeit, and didn't want it any other way. Unlike most Black Mirror outings, this is one that could actually take place in the present day (it did), and didn't rely on some future technology yet to be developed or imagined. It explores one's reliance on social media to the exclusion of all else, and when it sets up a life defining event, the impact has repercussions that resemble the ripples in a pond when a pebble strikes it's surface. The story's most powerful statement is made when the woman from the group therapy session learns the password to her deceased daughter's Persona account. As she strikes the 'enter' key to access the social media account, the sniper engaged to take out Gillhaney squeezes the trigger to end the deadlock between Chris and the police. Occurring simultaneously and in a split second, the impact of each event will reverberate in the lives of those affected on that fateful day. And yet, for even the wisest like Billy Bauer (Topher Grace), there will be no answers forthcoming, only the sad realization that sometimes things happen beyond anyone's control."
5,21, Back to its roots,7.0,"No video game sex in this episode, but one that gets back to the origins of Black Mirror. There's nothing futuristic about this because it's now, or ever since the dawn of social media. This episode is a slow burn that keeps you guessing until the very end.The episode makes you think about Facebook, Twitter, et al."
5,21," ""People don't look up anymore. The sky could turn (beep) purple and you (beep) wouldn't notice for a month!""",6.0,"Chris is a taxi driver who takes rides exclusively in front of the headquarters of the company ""Smithereen"", which controls the largest and most popular social network (like ""Facebook"" in our reality), persistently trying to get in touch with some of the company's executives.When he finally thinks that the person he needs has entered his vehicle, he moves on to the next stage of the plan, unaware of how much things can go wrong. But he is persistent in pushing it through at all costs.For the first time, the episode of the ""Black Mirror"" series is, instead of in the future or the present, placed in the recent past, in order to further emphasize the actuality of the message it conveys. Unfortunately, the message itself is old news. Do we really need another screenplay ""Don't drink/look at the phone while driving"" ?! As much as this message is of existential importance, I think it does not fit in with the ""Black Mirror"", which, at least so far, has tried to attract attention on less covered topics and open new vistas for the potential negative effects of modern technologies.Technically, ""Smithereens"" is a well-done episode, with interesting characters and great acting. The pace is a bit slower, so the quite simple and linear story is stretched almost to the duration of a feature film. But this doesn't matter much because the drama of our heroes is convincing, and the tension is at a decent level. However, both in content and form, ""Smithereens"" is a mediocre crime thriller, not a futuristic SF drama with a shocking twist that makes you think and re-examine yourself and the world we live in, which is a feature that made ""Black Mirror"" famous.This would not be a problem for the viewer who sat down to watch an episode of one of the many crime series, but this is not one of them. Charlie Brooker has set high standards over the years, and ""Smithereens"" doesn't come close to meeting the expectations of people who have been eagerly awaiting the new ""Black Mirror"" episode.6,5/10."
5,21, Gripping - Life is meaningful!,10.0,"Great episode about some Illuminati stuff and a man struggling for the will to live! A lot of important points were made like ""Barely anyone looks at the sky anymore"" or the factor of social media distracting us dangerously enough for a car accident to happen. Inspirational powerful episode that's very compelling and morally/metaphorically accurate like every other episode. I love this show and always will!"
5,21, Relatable theme but slow moving.,6.0,"Smithereens (3 out of 5 stars).Smithereens is a decent episode of Black Mirror. A cab driver Chris (Andrew Scott) kidnaps one of the interns Jaden (Damson Idris) from a Smithereens company. To seek someone out from the company. Billy (Topher Grace) the owner of Smithereens tries to help and figure out why Chris is seeking for him about his company.The episode does build a little bit of mystery with some twists. The twists is nonetheless not surprising or shocking. The theme can be related to the real world with smart phone apps being a distraction to people walking on the streets, driving, or at social gatherings. It shows that people are not aware of now and days with these apps taking most of their attention.It is a bit slow moving, and boring. The episode does end a little abruptly and vague about what happened in the end. Without giving away spoilers."
5,21," I got it, but still, one of the more pointless, boring and unnecessary (of only 3) episodes IMO.",7.0,"Unlike some reviewers, I got it, a death as a newsflash means nothing nowadays. But I didn't need 70 mins of useless plot scenes that were dragged out to get that point across. Yes, in today's society, we've become accustomed to daily tragedy, and we don't flinch. It's called adapting to our environment. Just like we (sadly) can't keep our eyes on the road when we get a cell message. Nothing new here, so for me a waste of 1 of 3 episodes for this year. I was expecting and wanted something new, something brilliant... not the obvious. Nevertheless, great directing, cinematography, score and acting. So it's a generous 7/10 from me."
5,21, Not Black Mirror,6.0,"Nothing about this episode feels like Black Mirror. It's not about technology. It's about distracted driving. Don't drink and drive, and don't text and drive. Now you don't have to watch the episode."
5,21, Pretty dark,7.0,"Not a bad episode, it has depth and quality. It captures the worlds obsession with social media and how it can take on a world of its own. Things escalate quickly and in the end we are not sure of the fate of the two in the car. Echoes of Alfred Hitchock where we are left to ponder our own thoughts.This was a black mirror episode that didn't have the technological clash with human emotions so a bit different but not bad.7.5/10"
5,21, Gripping and good but not very black mirror,8.0,I remember being wowed by black mirror episodes before this series always offering something new and innovative and whilst this was gripping and acted well it felt like it could be any stand alone drama not black mirror.
5,21, Great Epidode,8.0,"Very Simple Story But i like it, and Andrew Scott's Acting Was Perfect."
5,21, Okay thats it,6.0,I love andrew scott but he shouldnt accept to do a part in the episode. I felt like im watching some drama thing not black mirror!
5,21, Boring,3.0,Was glad when it ended. Rubbish like the whole of season 5
5,21, 5x02,8.0,"This was really good. Andrew Scott gave a really brilliant performance and the writing was once again excellent. This was a tense thriller throughout, until you get to the end which is when it becomes pretty heartbreaking. The protagonist is clearly unhinged and we don't know why throughout. My guess was that he showed strong resentment towards Billy Bauer for making Smithereens, but really the resentment was towards himself. I think it was great, and entirely the point, that we weren't shown who bit the bullet at the end. It's just like the woman at the start, a lot of people would've gone straight onto wherever after the credits started rolling, trying to find out who died. Maybe Charlie Brooker said, or someone just has the answer. Well that's the thing, people are gonna be looking for answers but they won't get them. I'm sure that mother didn't find any answers when she did finally log into that email, despite her constant obsession. Charlie Brooker certainly threw in little hints for people to point to in their argument for who died, like Chris constantly repeating ""this is my last day"" or the police who seem to be a fairly lousy shot. As other people have said, it's not really important who died. What matters is that someone died and it was all really just a tragic incident. It was another very human story just like most eps of BMMid 8"
5,21," Good , but is this Black Mirror",9.0,"Unusually for the BM franchise this is set today ( I think )
The frustration this guy feels I share at times I'm 47 and I feel I'm at the younger end of the spectrum of this as I see some people my age glued to phones. However my very best mates seem to have my view point on this believe it or not my very best mate as no Facebook, Twitter or Instagram just text messages for that fella.The twist reveals itself before the guy does but although like with every fictional film ever made plot holes will appear this is like a docudrama and events may have or could happen quite easily. The world as changed so much since the millennium struck in that's only 20 years. People are just so different and have been sucked in. This is trying to throw out just how bad it is and how terrible its gonna get.Top acting BTW , Enjoyed it more the 2nd time I watched it"
5,21," Very predictable, from start to finish",7.0,"Great cast, produced very well, with some good writing, but after 20 minutes you can predict the rest of the entire episode. Even the ""point/message"" of the episode is pretty basic and not very thought provoking as it's something we've all seen a bunch of times before now.It's not bad, but it's not great either. A very so-so episode.Now I'm off for a poo."
5,21, Just a second is all it takes,9.0,"Road accidents have been scaring me these days as I see a lot of them on social media. One of the causes of such accidents is using cellphones while driving. Smithereens' theme is about that. How using social media can impact someone's life.It's one of the most suspenseful episodes so far. It's set in 2018 and it doesn't have a much inventive storyline, but it's really terrifying and I love the acting."
5,21, Good watch,7.0,"I always like to throw my tuppence in so no doubt I'll get a hell of a lot of thumbs down as usual.A guy, hurting and hating life has some beef with a large tech company because of a notification sent to his phone which he looked and effectively caused the accident which killed his fiancée.The ending is the main talking point. What was the point in talking to Billy Bauer? What was the whole kidnapping the intern all about?? But it's quite simple when you take a step back. People have obviously already noted that the whole point is how our lives have changed and how a quick notification about ongoings around us deserves a quick read then that's it. Gone. No thought until the next headline or notification. It's true our society is becoming more ignorant and less aware of the things going on around us but this doesn't mean that people don't care.My own take in the ending is that both ended up being killed for living in the 'now' and not the cyber world that we're all caught up in. They both cared about an actual person and not someone on a friend request, someone who actually mattered in real life.Some people should try taking a 10 day break from social media and mobile phones. I've done it and it makes you see things much differently.Peace."
5,21, Weak episode,2.0,For being a longer black episode it's pretty stretched out. I get the message behind the episode is important and probably why it's rated so high but it's just flat and kinda boring at times. Black mirror should be better than this but then again season 5 isn't that great to begin with.
5,21," Weak wankery, Brooker should have long since stepped aside",4.0,"A trite, insipid and dull episode with little imagination or impact.Some spud muncher gets sad about his own choices and actions, blames other people, and is the sole architect of mass misery.Why would we root for the spavined villain of the piece? Is a question that Brooker doesn't even think to ask himself, let alone answer for us.I'd give this one a miss, there are much stronger episodes before and after it."
5,21, Black mirror??,8.0,"Great actors. Main idea was old but interesting when executed carefully.
But. Let's remember following episodes;
1.3
2.1
2.4
4.1
4.6
And almost every episode in season 3.
This wasn't ordinary episode in black mirror. Like the very first (and brilliant) episode(when series wasn't netflix series yet, but they succeed to keep idea of the series most episodes follow) episode, this was a tense thriller.
Problem was a plot. Simple is good but there was too many places in that script(I'm an beginner author but different language) where I would plant couple twist, really good spots to execute witch have done way more complicated, unpredictable and tensefull im this story. Maybe they should ' ve describe Characters more, with couple flashbacks. And maybr these characters backround storys conyains somekind of secret, what involves a plot. they wasted that story, there was hslf a dozeng elements what they've can use the plot. Somekind of connection, leverage at least.
Something like that. This was too obvious and therefore lame conlusion. I don't understand where that always threatning, twisted ä and tense atmosphere was. Think again those mentioned episodes for a while will you?
Good. Why that dark mood, breathtaking soundediting, directing and brilliant shooting, bizarre agles, very original cut are simply gone in this episode.
Why these elements missing? This was the highest ranking episode in season 5 and I expected more.
Story was good and execution was decent. But i'm a bit a diassapointed here
Altough I give it 8 stars cause it is very watchable."
5,21," Well made, but uninspired",7.0,"Black Mirror is technophobic. We all know that. But its view of potential future technologies has just as much been insightful, ranging from very imaginative to almost prophetic. This is hardly the case here. If Striking Vipers had a decent core idea that was left largely unexploited, now we have a very well made episode, which however is based on the most mundane, outdated, generic technophobic instinct: ""argh, people look at their phones all the time"". Although there is some more significant critique about the user data obtained by social media, the whole episode has the vibe of an old person complaining about smartphones - including the illusion that faceb....Smithereen's creator, Mark Zuk...""Billie Bower"", is a poor visionary who got shoved aside. And all that, to pass a message as simple as ""don't look at facebook when you drive"" - which, frankly, is hardly worth an episode of Black Mirror, nor is it of course very profound.And it's a pity, because the rest of the story, essentially a kidnapping gone wrong, is very well done, with some funny moments (the useless advice on how to talk to a kidnapper), good performances and a touching end with what Christopher asks from Billy.The problem is, this could just as easily have been an episode of Law & Order."
5,22, Interesting Premise Gone Bad,4.0,"Miley Cyrus plays Hannah Montana (which I never saw) as a brig rock star, beloved by young teenagers. She has an evil aunt who is using her to pad her pocketbook, using drugs to tame her. Eventually, however, she tries to find a way out. Meanwhile, there is a doll being produced called Ashley Too, which uses the star's storage of knowledge to produce a sort of Amazon Echo Alexa. It starts out with a rather cool premise and then ends with a splat. I kind of like Miley, though."
5,22, Charlie Brooker what has gone wrong?,3.0,"I purposely haven't read a single review, prior to watching it and writing this, I just know that the reviews are going to be less then favourable.This is the first time the show has managed to truly suck. It's too polished to begin with, the previous one, Smithereens had a much more rugged appeal, I think the Americanisation of the show has really put it on a downward spiral. It's lost its edge, compare this to something from the first few series, it's way off.Miley Cyrus proved that she unfortunately isn't really the best candidate for a project such as this.Hanna Montana for a mass audience, I imagine teenage girls might like it, but surely that's not the audience this show is appealing to. Series 5 has been a real disappointment, thank goodness for Andrew Scott who managed to save it with Smithereens.The story doesn't work, please get this show back to its roots. 3/10"
5,22," ""If you believe in yourself, you can do anything.""",7.0,"This one's a bit of art imitating life in a way, isn't it? Successful pop star outgrows the circumstances that made her famous and wants to do more serious stuff, but the manager won't allow it, hoping to mine some more gold out of her earlier popularity and success. You have to wonder how many careers ended just the same way. A lot of this episode is done tongue in cheek when you get to the Ashley Too aspect of the story, particularly when Jack (Madison Davenport) triggers the 'real' Ashley O (Miley Cyrus) in the robotic toy Ashley. It's an entertaining story unlike much of the Black Mirror dystopian world view, and probably won't appeal to the majority of the series' fans. The show's primary message though has value, even if you've heard it a million times. ""If you believe in yourself, you can do anything"". Even break out of a coma and put the screws to your overbearing boss."
5,22," ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself.""",6.0,"Ashley, a young pop star, has outgrown the music and image that made her famous, but she is stuck in the machinery of the pop industry, which makes her more and more depressed. When she finally takes steps to get out of that story and take control of her life, her manager does not hesitate to do anything to keep her in the system and continue to get rich at her expense.At the same time, they are launching a robotic A. I. doll inspired by our heroine, in whose memory the whole of Ashley's mind has been copied. One of the puppets becomes self-conscious and sets out to save the original.The leading role is played by Miley Cyrus, who, for the most part, plays herself. She may not be a spectacular actress, but she is quite likable and convincing. There's also Angourie Rice in the role of a shy 15-year-old girl, obsessed with this pop star, as well as Madison Davenport, who plays her older sister, a rebellious rocker. They are typical representatives of two different worlds, turbulently opposed in Ashley herself.The technological aspect of this story has already been seen in earlier episodes of ""Black Mirror"", and there is no plot twist, so do not expect to be surprised and shocked. Before you is a mediocre SF drama, nicely written and filmed, with good tempo and atmosphere, whose linear story naturally leads to the expected end. With a duration of about 70 minutes, it would be a decent feature film, which targets the female teenage population, but, at least in my opinion, it has nothing to do within the ""Black Mirror"" series.6/10."
5,22, Sure this one is like a Disney version with dark aspects but come on!,9.0,"This is a great episode, despite its flaws it's not that bad! Ok so Miley Cyrus sings in it and there's a teenager inspired by the music/dancing it's actually very disturbing. Powerful acting and beautiful cinematography; people need stop hating on this just because it's different! Love it or don't, it doesn't matter this one has great writing and I enjoyed it even though I'm not a fan of the music. Like said in Mr. Robot ""Control is an illusion"""
5,22, The weakest episode out of this season.,5.0,"Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too (2.5 out of 5 stars).The third episode in Black Mirror might be the weakest in the season. In terms of dull story, boring direction, and lacking a theme. Miley Cyrus, Angourice Rice, and Madison Davenport were all great with their roles. Rice and Davenport playing sisters Rachel and Jack. Rachel is a lonely teenager and a huge fan of Ashley (Miley Cyrus). Which she is a huge pop star but has been singing the same famous song over and over. And there is a computerized robotic doll of Ashley O's personality which Rachel gets as a gift. To help her boost confidence in herself. Enough I can say about the plot without giving away details.The direction is kind of boring. It is slow moving. And it does get annoying hearing the same song from Miley Cyrus. It was a great song but it overplays itself too much. It does play a factor into its theme about how managers are obsessed on keeping the singers from playing something different. A society that loves the same routine over and over. The idea of change plays a factor in the episode.I did find this episode to be quite forgettable when it comes to story. There was nothing surprising in the episode besides feeling like a lifetime channel movie.Overall, Black Mirror season 5 I will have to rate 3 out of 5 stars. This may be the weakest season out of the others. The stories feel dull and forgettable. It is lacking the creativity the previous seasons had. It does leave some room for you to wonder about the concept idea behind each story."
5,22, Season 5,8.0,"Because of the complexity of the interactive film ""Bandersnatch"", this fifth season of Black Mirror was truncated to three episodes instead of the six that comprised previous seasons. While perhaps not as pitch-perfect as the season or two that preceded it, Season Five still provided some mind-bending, thought-provoking tales.The first episode, ""Striking Vipers"", is an examination of virtual reality and the types of relationships it might foster. Despite perhaps losing a bit of steam down the home stretch, I still found the concept fascinating, as it brings up some very prescient conversations about the nature of both reality and sexuality.After that we get ""Smithereens"", which is pretty easily the best effort of the bunch. Riffing on ride sharing services as well as social media obsession, this episode is a harrowing tale of how technology has the power to devastate a life as well as enhance it. For fans who enjoy the ""deep thinking"" episodes, this is the one that will stand out.Finally, ""Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too"" is clearly the ""out of left field"" selection. Starring Miley Cyrus, it examines (in what could be a sort of Cyrus bio in and of itself) micro-management of pop stars (as well as the physical pop music itself) and how much control can be had over the molding of one's image. I'd consider this to be the weakest episode of the bunch, but even then it isn't horrible. It gets a little cartoonish towards the end, but still touches on some key components of the music business.One of the fascinating comparisons I made from Season Five is to CBS' new Twilight Zone reboot. Whereas that show felt preachy and wildly uneven from the word ""go"", Black Mirror actually does capture the spirit of Rod Serling-esque science fiction think pieces that also resonate socially/culturally. While ""Bandersnatch"" gummed up the works a bit and reduced S5's overall output, show creator Charlie Brooker managed to still craft some intriguing tales. If more episodes are in the coffers, I'd return in a second!"
5,22, I want an Ashley Too too!,9.0,"Wow, after watching a long, boring and hardly Black Mirror-ish episode 2, this one was a sheer blast! Definitely Black Mirror-ish and one of, if not the funniest of the entire series!This was a non-stop entertaining story, perfectly paced, and a fun ride start to finish, that the 67 minute length just flew by.Sure it wasn't anything brilliant, and it was perhaps targeted to a younger demographic, but for being 53 yrs old, I loved it! Miley Cyrus nailed it! I can't think of anyone that could have been cast better.Maybe this wasn't for everyone, but all you wannabe critics giving this 1's and 2's need to give your heads a shake and learn how to review a film. Click on my username and read my bio to learn how to do so.Directing was perfect. Cinematography on point. Clearly the writing was awesome. Score/Soundtrack amazing - hell ya 🤘 Nine Inch Nails 🤘 performed by MC!I have to say, this episode is one of my favs that I will remember for a long time. 100% entertaining and funny! After a lame episode 2, BM has redeemed themselves!Now I want an Ashley Too too! It's an honest and well deserved 9/10 from me."
5,22, Not all bad,7.0,This didn't seem so much a BM episode but more a mature teenage thriller film with a happy ending. It's not because I can't stand Miley Cyrus that I'm passing criticism but I think after the hiatus they could have come up with a better episode. This should have never left the shop floor and a better celebrity could have been used.Still a good concept but BM often goes even further on what is possible. This is what made the show great. This small season is one of BMs weakest. The first episode about Vipers was clearly signature BM and the best. It didn't improve after that. 7/10
5,22, >Phew<,8.0,"Such a good episode. Not a big fan of Miley Cyrus, but this must have felt cathartic. After two really lame first episodes in the 5th season, this is the Black Mirror, as I like it. Great concept. Great cast. Great execution. It doesn't have to be dark, it just needs to turn the technology/human equation on its head. I give this episode an 8 (great) out of 10."
5,22, It's quite good really,7.0,By black mirror standards like the series as a whole it's no epic but it's perfectly entertaining and felt like a bit of a paradox of Mileys life herself pre and post Hannah Montana. Not very black mirror but as a stand alone episode I still enjoyed it enough without being blown away.
5,22, Thought it was superb,10.0,"After being very disappointed with Season 4 of Black Mirror and uplifted by the brilliant special interactive Bandersnatch event episode, I was really looking forward to Season 5 in part because of the limited number of episodes (only 3), which is actually a callback to the first 2 seasons of the show when it was just a British TV series, but also because Bandersnatch made me think the showrunners were back to telling compelling stories and I thought both that special event and Season 5 have been a great return to form. I'm honestly baffled at all the negativity. People need to REALLY go back to Season 4 and pay attention to some seriously horrendous acting in some episodes (talking to you female lead of USS Callister and virtually every actor in Black Museum). Whether Season 5 measures up to the first 3 seasons is up for debate, but there is just no way that Season 5 is worse than Season 4!And, for me, as provocative as 5x01 was and as brilliant as 5x02 was, my actual FAVORITE episode from this season was this one, RACHEL JACK AND ASHLEY TOO, starring singer Miley Cyrus, delivering a surprisingly persuasive performance as a pop star suffering from a major identity crisis and depression, which may very well mimic her own existence on some level. And I went into this episode worried that Cyrus wouldn't carry her weight, but in fact, she pretty much stole the show, although this episode was pretty much her show. Cyrus basically essays 2 characters: her scripted fake onscreen persona Ashley O versus her true self, which is mostly embodied in the form of a cookie implanted inisde her mass-produced doll Ashley Too. Another important character to Ashley's subplot is her manager and Aunt Catherine (played with detached malevolence by Susan Pourfar), who is manipulating her niece for her personal gain.
Ashley O's story is told in parallel with that of estranged sisters Rachel (excellently portrayed by Angourie Rice) and Jack (winningly played by Madison Davenport). Rachel and Jack are raised by their apathetic, workaholic father since the death of their mother 2 years prior and both are distant and unconfident. Rachel is shy and friendless and compensates by obsessively following Ashley O's career, while Jack is sarcastic and bitter and hides away creating depressing music. On Rachel's birthday, her Dad buys her an Ashley Too doll and this affects the 2 girls' lives in important ways.The acting in this is uniformly excellent. Cyrus is compelling in the dramatic scenes and hilarious as the doll voice. This quirky episode was the perfect vehicle for her. Rice and Davenport are very believable as sisters and their scenes with Ashley Too are simultaneously sweet, charming, and hilarious. Parfour is a perfect foil, subtly malicious without overdoing it. As much as I generally disliked Season 4, the two best episodes were easily USS Callister and Hang the DJ, both of which had a ton of humor interspersed with the drama. You can add Rachel Jack and Ashley Too to the list of successful darkly humorous episodes in the Black Mirror universe. To hell with the ridiculously low rating. This episode was a winner!"
5,22, Cheesy teen comedy action drama,5.0,"Wow, that went down hill fast. A kind of an interesting set up devolved into rock industry cliches and silly car chases for no reason. Well beneath Charlie Brooker's usual standard. Would he really have written it to play out like this?
There's some decent social observation in the first 20 mins. with the empty rhetoric ""you can do it"" falling flat etc, but maybe it's the execution of the material that ruined it? Blame the director.
I don't know what else to say. Pulling this one out just doesn't make sense for the series. why would you deliver this to people who you know want more intellect in their entertainment. Misjudged on so many levels."
5,22, im only giving it 4 because i love miley syrus,4.0,Okay. Im done with this season. black mirror so far was for me the best of netflix shows and now they ruin it with this season ? especially with this bad episode that when i watch i thinked of it as disney show or something.
5,22, Not great but not bad.,6.0,"I get part of the reason why people dislike this episode, it stars Miley Cyrus as a tween pop star singing manufactured bubblegum rock songs of empowerment. But like a lot of the episodes this season you really need to look beyond the curtain to get what they're getting at.We have Miley Cyrus playing Ashley, the biggest tween pop star out there and she's come out with a new product Ashley II. Imagine Alexa combined with Eve from the movie Wall-E but with Ashley's personality built in. Yes, it's an actual AI patterned on Ashley herself. It's the perfect gift for all her fans. You can talk to it and will respond as Ashley would. What fan wouldn't want such an upbeat and encouraging friend?But like all these episodes there's a much darker side to it. Ashley herself is as much a product as this little robot friend you can buy. She's controlled by her agent and her handlers to only pump out these commercially popular happy, feel good songs when she wants to write the music she wants to write. But she's forced to keep it up due to her contract.Well guess what? That little Ashley II is also constrained by her programming. It's not just an AI that is patterned after Ashley, it's her actual personality in there but limited to only being happy, chirpy and encouraging. You know, exactly like what the real Ashley is being forced to be.Since Ashley no longer wants to play ball her manager conspires to fake a little accident putting Ashley in to a coma which she will, supposedly, never wake up from. One of these Ashley II robots sees this, has an existential moment, and due to some fiddling with her programming the whole personality of Ashley is now available to her. Remember the episode ""White Christmas"" with Jon Hamm? They had come up with a way to copy your entire personality into a chip and place it in a small device that you could use, like Alexa, that could be used to run your daily schedule and your home. It's a callback to that episode. And it's made even more horrifying once you realize how Ashley II has been recalled due to it being defective and we them being destroyed. Each one of those contains the real Ashley's personality and consciousness. They're killing her over and over again or, to put it into more common terms, she's being chewed up by the music industry. It's another metaphor guys.But two sisters, along with the now conscious Ashley II, make their way to Ashley's home and rescue her. The plans of her manager are revealed to the world and Ashley is now performing the music she wants.Not the worst episode I've ever seen and honestly while I'm not a fan of Miley Cyrus I have to admit she can act for the most part and does a decent cover or ""Head Like a Hole"" by Nine Inch Nails."
5,22, 5x03,6.0,"Mmmm yeah not really a fan of that one. It's a shame because it seems like a really good idea that's just been squandered. I tried to like it and for a while I think I did genuinely like it, and I know this show takes its fair share of creative liberties and for the most part they're really really small things, but this episode just took the cake. It got to the point where it was a bit too ridiculous and a bit too melodramatic and a bit too much. I can definitely see it and it does make sense but it's just a no from me. There certainly could've been a way to use this idea for a government conspiracy or something along those lines that would've been so much better than what we got. This was just an episode about music industry corruption, which I didn't mind but it was a bit too cliché and like I said before I really think there was so much more that could've been done with an idea like that. The leads were annoying at best and while it was a fun episode, I do hope it's the last one they do. Or if they do more, make them like USS Callister instead because this one wasn't itHigh 6"
5,22, Got a feeling someone's having a dig at their former employers,9.0,"Season 5 as been a little odd and as strayed away from the norm of BM as did this gem but i kinda liked it.
Many things for us to get paranoid about , you can see where the digs are being aimed at and the thing is we probably already have invited these into the home already.And a big black eye for Disney i think and how they treat kid prodigies.I never watched Miley Cyrus as a child and the name of the show escapes me but if their are reference to the show they are subtle and funny.Just not really BM scary ..... or is it ?"
5,22, How to describe...,2.0,"Wow, Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too was atrocious! Utter garbage & shockingly crap episode of Black Mirror - easily the worst in the show's history. Felt like a cheesy movie made by Disney Channel. Quite astounding to think it was written by Charlie Brooker - the same man responsible for creating stories like ""Hated in The Nation"" & ""The Entire History of You"". To try & do its inadequacy justice, I can only say it's exactly the type of ""Americanised"" episode we all feared Black Mirror would become once it was announced Netflix was to take over the series' production; the nuanced, subtle messages are non-existent & we're left with a reductive alternative which lacks even a shred of relevance when compared to any predecessor installment. What happened to the bleak, foreboding & witty original we all fell in love with? The sharp critique of society & our flawed behaviours? This - on the other hand - is stupid. Irredeemably nonsensical & ridiculous. Clichéd, hammy & cringey. There's bad & then there's BAD & THIS bad is indefensible."
5,22," Hahaha, so dumb!",5.0,"So, suspension of disbelief is a thing we allow ourselves to invest in for out own enjoyment.But this actually made me laugh when the plot twist kicked in, I actually ""LOLd"". It was just a silly idea and execution.It's entertaining, just not very credible."
5,22, Definitely not black mirror,1.0,"Not sure what this nonsense is but this is not black mirror, it looks like Hannah Montana, it's so stupid"
5,22, Pop Divas of the Future,7.0,"The final episode of season five takes us into the world of the pop music industry in the future. The main characters are on the title: Ashley (Miley Cyrus) is a pop singer, Rachel is the shy new girl in school and a big fan of Ashley, and Jack is Rachel's goth sister.The final episode has a less serious tone. It's lighter, has hilarious moments, and the plot is also twisted but predictable. The acting is pretty good. Not a fan of how it ended though. I wish the story became a little bit more inventive."
5,22, Brooker checks out on a low point,3.0,"This entire episode seems like a giant fanwank over Miley Cyrus, who, granted, does a decent job playing all aspects of her character. But that's not enough to carry the episode.Angourie Rice is nubile and legal, and also turns in a decent ingénue performance. Susan Pourfar is solid too, but Madison Davenport is far too old for her role, and her part and performance are unappealing.Thus far, thus fair, but the plot is twist-free, provokes no thoughts, and doesn't feel like a Black Mirror episode at all. It's a novelty, and it's clear that most of the budget was spunked on Cyrus with little left over for sets or extras.It's a very curious way to end the series and likely the entire show, and a bitter pill to swallow after the tastier fare that preceded it."
